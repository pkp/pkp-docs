# DOAJ Application Guide for OJS Journals

Those that wish to have their journal included in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) must complete an application form, meet DOAJ’s criteria, and be accepted to the DOAJ. This guide provides information for journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS) on how to represent and link to information in OJS that is relevant for DOAJ inclusion and the DOAJ application.

The DOAJ Indexing for OJS Journals webinar hosted by PKP in May 2023 goes over the key considerations in meeting DOAJ inclusion requirements:

## What is DOAJ and why should I apply?

DOAJ is a directory that indexes and provides access to high quality, open access, peer-reviewed journals. Open access journals from all countries and in all languages can apply for inclusion. There is no cost for journals to apply or be listed in DOAJ. The service aims to raise the reputation and visibility of open access journals from around the world. For more details on benefits for journals, see [(Why Index Your Journal in DOAJ?)](https://doaj.org/apply/why-index/)

## Before you apply (DOAJ readiness)

Are you ready? Your journal must:

1.  Comply with DOAJ’s [Open Access Policy](https://blog.doaj.org/2020/11/17/what-does-doaj-define-as-open-access/).
2.  Have a website with a dedicated URL and homepage.    
3.  Have a confirmed journal title and [ISSN](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/getting-found-staying-found/en/getting-found-visibility#issns).    
4.  Follow a quality control process including having an editorial board, a peer review process, and limits on the publication of research papers authored by editors, members of the editorial board, or reviewers.    
5.  Have clearly stated copyright and licensing terms applied to all articles. See [Copyright and Licensing](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/journal-policies-workflows/en/copyright-licensing) to learn more.    
6.  Have published at least 5 research articles in the last year; for new or flipped journals - have a publishing history of more than 1 year, or at least 10 open access research articles.    

See [the DOAJ’s Guide to Applying](https://doaj.org/apply/guide/) for a full list of DOAJ’s basic criteria for inclusion.

## The DOAJ Application

This section will help you to complete [the DOAJ application](https://doaj.org/apply/) for your OJS journal. You will be required to register an account with basic information (a name and email address) in order to use the online form.

All of the questions must be answered in order for the application to be complete; however, some of the questions encourage best practice and are not required for acceptance to DOAJ. You can save your form’s progress and return to complete it at a later date if needed.

This list of items was adapted from the Library Publishing Coalition’s [How-To Guide for Library Publishers: Directory of Open Access Journals Application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1_JRbqX36wqSw7FlMiAqmAhrOzRW-q__XiEa4tvVdY).

This guide was most recently updated to include guidance and paths for OJS 3.3+.

This guide includes advice on (1) where to enter relevant information in OJS and, (2) where relevant information appears publicly on your OJS site.

If you are looking for further explanation on what the questions mean, please refer to [the LPC Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1_JRbqX36wqSw7FlMiAqmAhrOzRW-q__XiEa4tvVdY/) or the help text included alongside the online form.

### Open Access Compliance

**Does the journal adhere to DOAJ’s definition of open access?**

The DOAJ requires journals to adopt a form of Libre Open Access—a type of open access that not only removes price barriers to content but also relaxes limitations on users’ rights. The DOAJ recommends that copyright of articles be retained by authors, but will also accept journals where copyright is held in full or in part by the publisher, so long as articles are offered under an open license. [Read more about DOAJ’s definition of open access](https://blog.doaj.org/2020/11/17/what-does-doaj-define-as-open-access/).

**The journal website must display its open access statement. Where can we find this information?**

* Enter this information in Journal Settings > Masthead > Description > About the Journal. See [Learning OJS: Journal Settings - Masthead.](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/journal-setup#masthead) Provide the link to the About the journal page.
* You may want to create a section in the About the Journal text box for the Open Access statement.
* An example of an acceptable OA statement is: 
> This is an open access journal which means that all content is freely available without charge to the user or his/her institution. Users are allowed to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of the articles, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without asking prior permission from the publisher or the author.

### Best Practices

DOAJ recommends adoption of the following best practices, but these are not required for inclusion in DOAJ.

#### Archiving policy

**Long-term preservation service(s) where the journal is currently archived**

* Select all that apply from the following:
	* CINES
	* CLOCKSS
	* LOCKSS
	* Internet Archive
	* PKP PN
	* PubMed Central (PMC)
	* Portico
	* A national library
	* Other
	* The journal content isn’t archived with a long-term preservation service

_Institutional archives and publishers’ own online archives are not valid._
    
* If you are a member of LOCKSS or CLOCKSS, enable archiving in Distribution Settings > Archiving > LOCKSS and CLOCKSS. See [Learning OJS: Distribution Settings - Archiving](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-distribution#archiving).
* The PKP PN is available for free as part of OJS. Please read the [PKP Preservation Network Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/en/) for more information.

***Where can we find this information? (If Archived)***

* If any service(s) are selected, you will be prompted to enter the URL with information on your preservation policy. If you are archiving your content in any of the above networks, this information will not automatically be displayed on your OJS site. You can add your archiving policy to the About page or another page and link to it here.
    
#### Repository policy

**Does the journal have a policy allowing authors to deposit versions of their work in an institutional or other repository of their choice? Where is this policy recorded?**

* Select all that apply from the following:
	* Sherpa/Romeo
	* Dulcinea
	* Héloïse
	* Diadorim
	* Other
	* The journal has no repository policy
    
***Where can we find this information? (If existing policy)***

* In OJS, display the journal’s Author Self-Archiving Policy on your About page or under Author Guidelines or as part of the Copyright Statement. Read more at [Journal Policies and Workflows: Self-Archiving Policies](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/journal-policies-workflows/en/oa-policies#self-archiving-policies).
* If the policy was added to one of the above databases, link to the policy page there.
    
#### Unique identifiers & structured data

**Persistent article identifiers used by the journal**

* Select from the following:
	* DOIs
	* ARKs
	* Handles
	* PURLs
	* Other
	* The journal does not use persistent article identifiers

OJS can generate DOIs as part of the metadata and allows deposit of those DOIs directly to Crossref, DataCite, or mEDRA (with respective membership) . See the [DOI Plugin Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/doi-plugin/en/) and [the Crossref OJS Manual](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref-ojs-manual/en/) for more details on how to set up DOIs in OJS.
    
**Does the journal allow for ORCID iDs to be present in article metadata?**

* Select “Yes” or “No”. See the [ORCID Plugin Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/orcid/en/) for more information on how to set up ORCID in OJS.
    
**Does the journal comply with I4OC standards for open citations?**

* Select “Yes” or “No”. See the [Plan S: Open Citation Data](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plan-s/en/#open-citation-data) guide for more information on how to set up open citations in OJS.

## DOAJ SEAL

For journals following best practice in OA publishing. [Read more about the DOAJ Seal](https://doaj.org/apply/seal/)

During the application process, you can be awarded the DOAJ SEAL if these 7 criteria are all met. _A journal can be indexed in the DOAJ without meeting the DOAJ seal requirements._

### 1. Digital preservation

This demonstrates that the journal ensures the long-term availability and preservation of published content for the future. The DOAJ will accept preservation service providers registered in the [Keepers Registry](https://keepers.issn.org/keepers) (e.g., PKP PN LOCKSS/CLOCKSS. Portico, British Library, etc.), Internet Archive, and/or PubMed Central. Please note that institutional servers and repositories do not qualify as long term archival preservation.

See [Learning OJS: Distribution Settings - Archiving](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-distribution#archiving) for more details.

### 2. Persistent article identifiers

These ensure articles may continue to be found even when URLs change. The most common form of persistent identifier is the [DOI](https://dx.doi.org/) (Digital Object Identifier), but there may be others in use for a journal.

OJS can generate DOIs as part of the metadata and allows deposit of those DOIs directly to Crossref, DataCite, or mEDRA (with respective membership) . See the [DOI Plugin Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/doi-plugin/en/) and [the Crossref OJS Manual](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref-ojs-manual/en/) for more details on how to set up DOIs in OJS.

### 3. Metadata supply to DOAJ

Provide greater visibility and discoverability of journal content by providing article-level metadata and links to the full text. Metadata must be provided to the DOAJ within 3 months via article-level xml metadata file uploaded to the DOAJ interface or by the DOAJ API.

You can use the OJS DOAJ Export Plugin at Tools > Import/Export > DOAJ Export Plugin. Read more about [the DOAJ export plugin](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/3.3/en/data-import-and-export#doaj-export-plugin).

To learn more about creating metadata, see [the Better Practices in Journal Metadata guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/metadata-practices/en/).

### 4. License type

To allow for generous reuse and remixing of the content. The DOAJ Seal allows for 4 of the Creative Commons licenses: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-NC-SA. The DOAJ Seal does not consider any of the Creative Commons licenses that restrict remixing or the creation of derivative products of the published content (e.g. CC-BY-ND, CC-BY-NC-ND).

In OJS, when selecting the license to be embedded with the article metadata and displayed on its webpage, be certain to select one of the following license types: CC Attribution, CC Attribution-ShareAlike, or CC Attribution-Noncommercial. You can select it under Distribution Settings > License.

See  [Journal Policies and Workflows: Creative Commons Licenses](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/journal-policies-workflows/en/copyright-licensing#creative-commons-licenses) for more details.

### 5. License information in articles

To ensure readers (users) know and understand what they are permitted to do with the content, license information must be embedded into each published article, in all its outputs - e.g. on the HTML article webpage, in the XML/metadata and PDF version.

OJS offers the Creative Commons license options that are acceptable for the DOAJ seal: CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, or CC BY-NC-SA. This license will be embedded in the metadata of published items and displayed on the item’s webpage. Select the Creative Commons license you will use in Distribution Settings > License.

See  [Journal Policies and Workflows: Where to add Copyright and Licensing Information in OJS](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/journal-policies-workflows/en/copyright-licensing#where-to-add-copyright-and-licensing-information-in-ojs) for more details.

### 6. Copyright and publishing rights

The DOAJ Seal expects journals to allow copyright to be retained by the author and not be transferred to the journal or publisher. The journal and publisher must not obtain exclusive publishing rights to the content. DOAJ Best Practice recommends the terms of any license agreement should be made freely available to clarify author rights and what, if anything, authors are required to sign when submitting to the journal.

In OJS you can select the designated copyright holder for the article metadata as the Author, Journal, or Other. To select the Author as the designated copyright holder, go to Distribution Settings > License > Copyright Holder.

See [Journal Policies and Workflows: Copyright and Licensing](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/journal-policies-workflows/en/copyright-licensing) for more details.

### 7. Self-archiving policy

Provide information on authors’ self-archiving rights, which should cover their rights to self-archive preprint, accepted, final publisher versions of the article, usually in places like their own website or institutional repository. For the Seal, authors must be permitted to deposit all versions of their paper in an institutional or subject repository and no embargo can be applied. DOAJ prefers a policy to be listed on services like [SHERPA/RoMEO](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/).

In OJS, enter the journal’s Author Self-Archiving Policy on your About page or under Author Guidelines or as part of the Copyright Statement. Read more at [Journal Policies and Workflows: Self-Archiving Policies](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/journal-policies-workflows/en/oa-policies#self-archiving-policies).

## Upgrading from OJS 2 to 3

If you have upgraded from OJS 2 to OJS 3 after your DOAJ application was accepted, you will need to do the following:
* Check that the journal information required in the application is still present on your journal website and in the same places. Information about the journal is included on different pages in OJS 2 and OJS 3.
* Submit an update request to DOAJ where page URLs have changed (e.g. About, Contact, etc.).
* If you send article metadata to DOAJ, check that [the DOAJ export plugin](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/3.3/en/data-import-and-export#doaj-export-plugin) is enabled and the API key is entered.
