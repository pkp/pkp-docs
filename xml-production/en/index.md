# Introduction

This document is a guide to the tools and editorial procedures that can be used with Open Journal Systems to prepare and publish articles in [JATS XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_Article_Tag_Suite), a widely used standard for publishing and distributing scholarly articles. It is written for journal managers, managing editors or system administrators who want to produce XML as part of their publishing efforts.

JATS XML is a complex, technical specification for describing a journal in a machine-readable format. Typesetting an article in JATS XML can be a difficult process. However, once an article has been typeset in JATS XML it becomes possible to automate tasks, such as generating PDFs, depositing citation information, or data-mining research articles.

This guide will help you navigate the options that are available, understand what to expect from them, set up and configure the tools for a journal, and train editorial staff to get the best results.

## Production Workflow

The XML production workflow recommended in this guide is a three-step process that includes automated and manual tasks.

1. The full text of an article's submission is [automatically converted](./convert) to JATS XML in a process that often introduces errors.
2. The JATS XML is then [manually copyedited and typeset](./edit) by editorial staff to correct errors and prepare the final proof.
3. When the article is [published](./publish), full-text HTML and PDFs are automatically generated from the JATS XML.

This guide will focus on free, scholar-owned tools that the Public Knowledge Project recommends in order to accomplish each step, along with the limitations of these tools and any editorial guidelines needed to use them correctly.

Many publishing services may be able to take advantage of other tools and services to perform some or all of these steps. For example, a publisher may contract with a professional typesetting service to perform the initial conversion process with fewer errors. Publishers with technical support staff may find it easier to implement their own tools for HTML and PDF generation. This guide will mention these alternatives but can not provide a recommendation.
