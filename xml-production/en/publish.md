## A Note on Article Metadata

Publishing professionals familiar with JATS XML may be familiar with tools that handle metadata, such as an article's title, abstract and keywords, when converting, editing or publishing XML. In OJS, this metadata (the frontmatter and backmatter of a JATS XML document) is handled separately from the main body of the article.

For this reason, the conversion, editing and publishing tools described in this document focus on the article's main body and citations. Only when the article is published is the metadata and article body merged into a complete JATS XML document.
