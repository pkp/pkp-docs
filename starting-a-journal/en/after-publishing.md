# Apply for an ISSN

ISSN is an international organization that assigns unique codes for serial publications (including newspapers, journals, magazines, and other periodicals). ISSNs are assigned by national centres for country-based journals, or by the central international organization for international journals. To request an ISSN, consult the [ISSN guidelines](https://www.issn.org/services/requesting-an-issn/) that apply to you. An ISSN is essential for almost all distribution processes.

# Register for a DOI

DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) are unique & persistent identifiers, usually assigned to each piece of content (i.e. an article). You can assign a DOI using an OJS plugin. Then, DOIs must be registered through a DOI registration agency, such as Crossref, and there is a cost associated with creating DOIs. See [DOI Plugin Guide](​​https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/doi-plugin/en/).

# Join the Preservation Network

The PKP Preservation Network (PKP PN) is a LOCKSS program that offers decentralized and distributed preservation of OJS content at no cost. The PKP PN is a “dark” preservation network that is not open to the public until a “trigger event” happens when the active journal ceases publication. See [PKP PN description](https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/) and detailed [PKP PN guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/en/).

# Get your content indexed

Consider how your journal content will be discovered by your target audiences and others - for example, through journal indexes, Search Engine Optimization, and marketing. Be sure to follow the guidance in the [Metadata Better Practices Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/metadata-practices/en/) to ensure that your journal metadata is optimized for search engines and indexes to successfully retrieve it. See our [Google Scholar Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/google-scholar/) for tips on ensuring that your journal is successfully indexed in Google Scholar. See our [Indexing Application Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/indexing-guide/en/) and [Getting Found, Staying Found](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/getting-found-staying-found/) for further details about making your journal content discoverable.
