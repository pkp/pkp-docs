# Crossref | OJS Manual

[PKP](http://pkp.sfu.ca) and [Crossref](http://www.crossref.org/) are collaborating to help publishers and journals using [Open Journal Systems](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/) take better advantage of Crossref services. As of 2014, PKP has become a Sponsoring Organization of Crossref, and as such will be providing much improved Crossref integration and overall support for the service. Additionally, PKP can now act as a sponsor representative for OJS journals wishing to apply for Crossref membership, and is in some cases able to waive fees.
