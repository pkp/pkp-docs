# Data Import and Export

Open Journal Systems offers a variety of tools and plugins which allow you to inject data into and extract data from OJS. This chapter explains how to use import and export tools and plugins. More information can be found in each plugin's documentation within OJS' plugin directory \(plugins/\).

Most import and export functions can be carried out by logging in as Journal Manager and going to Tools &gt; Import/Export.

However, in some cases import/export plugins need to be installed or enabled first under Settings &gt; Website &gt; Plugins. How to access and use specific plugins and functions are explained in the sections below.
