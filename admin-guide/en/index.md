# Administrator's Guide

This is a guide for system administrators who want to install, deploy and maintain [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs), [Open Monograph Press (OPS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/omp) or [Open Preprint Systems (OPS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ops). It covers everything from getting started with your first test install to optimizing large production instances and importing and exporting data.

- [Security](./securing-your-system) — Best practices for running a secure server. Read this if you're not confident about securing your server.
- [Statistics](./statistics) — An overview of the statistics available in the system. Read this if you need to compile reports about readers, registered users, editorial activity or subscriptions.
