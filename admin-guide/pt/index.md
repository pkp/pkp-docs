# Administrator's Guide

This is a guide for system administrators who want to install, deploy and maintain [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs), [Open Monograph Press (OPS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/omp) or [Open Preprint Systems (OPS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ops).

## Começando

In order to install this software securely, you will need to understand how to do the following:

- Upload and edit files on your web server
- Modify file permissions on your web server
- Configure a cron job on your web server
- Manage file storage and memory limits on your web server
- Configure a SSL certificate for your domain

If you are unfamiliar with some of these topics, you may be able to learn by following tutorials on the web. However, if you do not know how to deploy applications to a web server, we recommend that you find technical support for your project. This may be available through your research institution, a library publishing service, or a paid service provider like PKP's [Publishing Services](https://pkp.sfu.ca/hosting).
