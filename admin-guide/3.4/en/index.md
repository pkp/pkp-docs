# Administrator's Guide

This is a guide for system administrators who want to install, deploy and maintain [Open Journal Systems (OJS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs), [Open Monograph Press (OMP)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/omp) or [Open Preprint Systems (OPS)](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ops). It covers everything from getting started with your first test install to optimizing large production instances and importing and exporting data.
