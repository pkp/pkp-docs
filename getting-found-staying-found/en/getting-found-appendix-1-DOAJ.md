# Appendix 1: DOAJ Application Guide for OJS Journals

Publishers who wish to have their journal included in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) have to fill out an extensive application form to indicate that the journal meets DOAJ's criteria. This appendix provides guidance for journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS) on how to represent and link to information in OJS that is relevant for DOAJ inclusion and the DOAJ application.  

## What is DOAJ and why should I apply?

> "The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is a service that indexes high quality, peer reviewed Open Access research journals, periodicals and their articles' metadata. The Directory aims to be comprehensive and cover all open access academic journals that use an appropriate quality control system (see below for definitions) and is not limited to particular languages, geographical region, or subject areas. The Directory aims to increase the visibility and ease of use of open access academic journals—regardless of size and country of origin—thereby promoting their visibility, usage and impact." [(What is DOAJ?)](https://doaj.org/faq#whatis)

## Before you apply (DOAJ readiness)

Are you ready? Your journal must:
1. Be online and fully open access.
2. Have a confirmed journal title and [ISSN](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/getting-found-staying-found/en/getting-found-visibility#issns).
3. Have published at least 5 research articles in the last year.
4. Have a Creative Commons or equivalent license applied to all articles. See [Copyright and Licensing](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/getting-found-staying-found/en/getting-found-increasing-impact#copyright-and-licensing) to learn more.

## The DOAJ Application

This section will help you to complete [the DOAJ application](https://doaj.org/application/new) for your OJS journal. The numbers of these items match the numbered questions on the DOAJ application.

All of the questions must be answered in order for the application to be complete; however, some of the questions only provide supplemental information to DOAJ and are not required for acceptance to DOAJ. The questions that are required for acceptance to DOAJ are marked with the letter **D**. Some additional questions are required for being awarded the DOAJ Seal. These are marked with the letter **S**. Questions that are not marked should still be answered. 

This list of items was adapted from the Library Publishing Coalition's [How-To Guide for Library Publishers: Directory of Open Access Journals Application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1_JRbqX36wqSw7FlMiAqmAhrOzRW-q__XiEa4tvVdY).

Next to each item is information about how to enter this information in OJS and, where applicable, where to link to it on your OJS site.

If you are looking for further explanation on what the questions mean, please refer to [the LPC Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x1_JRbqX36wqSw7FlMiAqmAhrOzRW-q__XiEa4tvVdY/) or [DOAJ’s Information for Publishers page](https://doaj.org/publishers).

<hr />

\[**D**\] This is a basic requirement for entry into DOAJ

\[**S**\] This is a DOAJ Seal requirement

## DOAJ SEAL

For journals following best practice in OA publishing.

During the application process, you can be awarded the DOAJ SEAL if these 7 criteria are all met. __A journal can be indexed in the DOAJ without meeting the DOAJ seal requirements.__

**1. Digital archiving of content** (Question 25)

The DOAJ Seal is looking at how the journal can ensure the long-term availability and preservation of published content for the future. The DOAJ will accept some preservation service providers (e.g., LOCKSS/CLOCKSS. Portico, PubMed Central) as well as some national libraries (e.g., British Library, Library of Congress). Please note that institutional servers and repositories do not qualify as long term archival preservation.

If you are a member of LOCKSS or CLOCKSS, enable this here:
Settings > Website > Archiving

See [Chapter 6: Website Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#archiving) for more details.

**2. Permanent identifiers** (Question 28)

Ensure articles may continue to be found even when URLs change. The most common form of permanent identifier is the Digital Object Identifier [DOI](https://dx.doi.org/), but there may be others in use for a journal.

OJS can generate DOIs as part of the metadata and allows deposit of those DOIs directly to CrossRef (you must be a member of CrossRef to register DOIs):

Tools > Import/Export > CrossRef XML Export Plugin

See the [Crossref OJS Manual](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/crossref-ojs-manual/en/) for more details.

**3. Metadata supply to the DOAJ** (Question 29)

Provide greater visibility and discoverability of journal content by providing article-level metadata and links to the full text. Metadata must be provided to the DOAJ within 3 months via article-level xml file or by the DOAJ API.

You can use the OJS DOAJ Import/Export Plugin at Tools > Import/Export > DOAJ Export Plugin.

See [PKP Administrator Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) for more details.

**4. Embedded license information** (Question 45)

To ensure readers (users) know and understand what they are permitted to do with the content, license information must be embedded into each published article, in all its outputs - e.g. on the HTML article webpage, in the XML/metadata and PDF version.

OJS offers the Creative Commons license options that are acceptable for the DOAJ seal: CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, or CC BY-NC-SA. This license will be embedded in the metadata of published items and displayed on the item’s webpage.
Select the Creative Commons license you will use in Settings > Distribution > Permissions

See [Chapter 8: Distribution Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-distribution#permissions) for more details.

**5. Allow reuse via selected Creative Commons licenses** (Question 47)

To allow for generous reuse and remixing of the content. The DOAJ Seal allows for 4 of the Creative Commons licenses: CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-NC-SA. The DOAJ Seal does not consider any of the Creative Commons licenses that restrict remixing or the creation of derivative products of the published content (e.g. CC-BY-ND, CC-BY-NC-ND).

In OJS, when selecting the license to be embedded with the article metadata and displayed on its webpage, be certain to select one of the following license types: CC Attribution, CC Attribution-ShareAlike, or CC Attribution-Noncommercial.

In OJS select the Creative Commons license you will use in Settings > Distribution > Permissions

**6. Deposit policy** (Question 51)

Provide information on authors self-archiving rights in a statement clarifying to authors what their rights are for self-archiving, which should cover their rights to self-archive preprint, accepted, final publisher versions of the article, usually in places like their own website or institutional repository. The DOAJ requires a policy to be listed for a journal and checks what policy is listed for the journal on services like [SHERPA/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php).

In OJS enter the journal’s Author Self-Archiving Policy in Settings > Distribution > Permissions

**7. Authors retain unrestricted copyright and publishing rights.** (Question 52)

The DOAJ Seal expects journals to allow copyright to be retained by the author and not be transferred to the journal or publisher. The journal and publisher must also not obtain exclusive publishing rights to the content, but instead these must be retained by the author. The DOAJ Best Practice recommends the terms of any license agreement should be made freely available to clarify author rights and what, if anything, authors are required to sign when submitting to the journal.

In OJS you can select the designated copyright holder for the article metadata as the Author, Journal, or Other. To select the Author as the designated copyright holder, go to Settings > Distribution > Permissions.

## Upgrading from OJS 2 to 3

If you have upgraded from OJS 2 to OJS 3 after your DOAJ application was accepted, you will need to do the following:

* Check that the journal information required in the application is still present on your journal website and in the same places. Information about the journal is included on different pages in OJS 2 and OJS 3.
* Submit an update request to DOAJ where page URLs have changed (e.g. About, Contact, etc.).
* If you send article metadata to DOAJ, check that [the DOAJ export plugin](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) is enabled and the API key is entered.
