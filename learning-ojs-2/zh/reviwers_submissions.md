# Submissions

After logging in to the journal the Reviewer will arrive at the User Home page.

This user is both an Author and Reviewer. To see the submissions to review, click the **Reviewer** link, or click the **"x" Active** link. Both will take you to your Active Submissions page. This page lists the submissions which you have been invited to review or are currently in the process of reviewing. The Submissions queue also notes when the review is due and what round the review is, as some reviews may have entered a second round of reviewing, following the Section Editor's decision that the submission must be "resubmitted for review." This page also provides access to past reviews which the Reviewer has completed for the journal.

Clicking on the linked title of an **active submission** will take you to the review process.
