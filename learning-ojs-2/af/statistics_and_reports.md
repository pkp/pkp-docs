# Statistics and Reports

OJS provides a number of statistical and reporting features for your journal. To access them, go to the Journal Management Pages and select **Stats & Reports**.

### Statistics

The Statistics section provides a summary of your journal's usage. You can use the checkboxes to make these statistics available to readers in About the Journal. If your journal has been running for several years you would be able to click through by year and see totals for issues and items published, and other powerful statistics.

### Reports

The Reports section provides spreadsheets of data on all of the articles submitted to your journal, all of the reviews that have been done, and other aspects of your journal's activity.

* **Subscriptions Report** summarizes membership information for individual and institutional subscriptions
* **Review Report **summarizes the review activities including article and reviewer names, and dates of assignments.
* **OJS Usage Statistics Report** Summarizes all published objects \(article, galleys, issue, issue galleys\) view or download counts, and also the journal index page view counts.

The option to **Generate a Custom Report** is also available by selecting the link from the Stats & reports page.

Report templates are available, and you can make selections based on location and date range. Advanced options allow you to customize columns to build the report, choose filters to narrow results, and select the order in which results will display.
