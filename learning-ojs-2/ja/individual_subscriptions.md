To create a new individual subscription, select the **Create New Subscription** link. If the user already has an account with the journal their name will appear here. Use their Select link to sign them up with a subscription.

If the new subscriber does not already have an account, you can create one for them by selecting the **Create New User** link at the bottom of the screen. You then need to fill in the resulting form.
