# Community Contributions

The OJS team encourages contributions from the developer community. If you are interested in getting involved in making OJS even better, we welcome your participation.

Excellent examples of community contributions include the vast array of [languages](https://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Translating_OxS#OJS_Languages) that OJS is available in; and third-party plugins posted to the [community forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/) and the [archived forum](https://pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/viewforum.php?f=28) page.

We also welcome software testing and bug reporting contributions.
