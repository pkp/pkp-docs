# Getting Help

If you need help with OJS, there are several resources at your disposal.

The Open Journal Systems platform has a help document that is contextually embedded within itself, with the relevant pages displayed depending on the page you are currently viewing. You can find this context-senstive help by clicking the Journal Help link (typically located on the right navigation bar). You can also view the help document at [OJS Help](http://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/demo/present/index.php/index/help/).


You will find relevant documentation on our [OJS Documentation](https://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=OJS_Documentation) page, the [PKP School](http://pkpschool.sfu.ca/) offers self-paced courses for journal managers, editors, authors and reviewers, and many of these videos are also available on the [PKP YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PublicKnowledgeProj/) page.

Our [support forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/) is an active place to find help with common and uncommon problems. We highly recommend you search the forum for past answers to questions, and post your own question if you can't find an answer. The [old forum](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7100/20160819234652/https:/pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/index.php) will continue to be available as an archive, but new posts are no longer permitted.

Finally, our [development wiki](https://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page) is a storehouse of developer-centric information, including specialized documentation on extending OJS themes and plugin-wise; information on translating OJS; and roadmaps and general software milestone information.

All of these links can be accessed right from the [PKP homepage](http://pkp.sfu.ca) under the Support menu.
