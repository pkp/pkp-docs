# Chapter 12: Proofreaders


The Proofreader will receive an email from the Section Editor requesting that the Proofreader complete a round, or rounds, of proofreading. It is then the Proofreader's duty to accept or decline the responsibility; if accepted, the Proofreader can then log in and begin the proofreading process from their User Home page.


Upon logging in, clicking on the **Proofreader** link on the User Home page leads to the **Active Submissions** page, which displays submissions requiring proofreading. You can access past submissions under the Archive link. To access the submission's proofreading page, click on the article title.
