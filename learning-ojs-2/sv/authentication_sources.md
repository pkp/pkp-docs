By default, OJS authenticates users against its internal database. It is possible, however, to use other methods of authentication, such as LDAP. Additional authentication sources are implemented as OJS plugins; refer to the documentation shipped with each plugin for details.

To access authentication settings, click the **Authentication Sources **link from the Site Administration page; you will be presented with the following options.

By default only the OJS User Database is listed. To add a new source, choose one from the drop-down menu and click the Create button. You will then be asked to configure the source.
