# Viewing and Reading Overview

By default, Open Journal Systems is installed with a very simple, functional user interface. This includes a top header, a top navigation bar, a series of navigation blocks to the right, and a main content block in the middle of the page.

Finally, it's worth noting that both HTML and PDF galleys can be read on mobile devices, without the need of any special apps (aside from a web browser, of course).

The OJS interface can be extensively customized by uploading new stylesheets at the site, journal, and article level, and by various other journal-specific customizations. For the advanced user, the underlying template system can also be modified. As open source software, you are free to customize OJS as you wish.
