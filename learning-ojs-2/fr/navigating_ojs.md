# Chapter 2: Navigating OJS

Open Journal Systems has been designed as a multi-journal system which can host any number of journals on a single installation. Visitors have access to overall site-level pages, and can also navigate to any journal's individual pages from the site's home page.

**Example of Multi-Journal Site Page**

In this example, users will see a list of all the journals hosted by the University of Guelph from the site-level main page, and can visit a journal by clicking on the **View Journal** link.

The system can also be set up to redirect visitors to a single journal, which is helpful if the site is hosting only one journal.



**Example of Single Journal Page**

To navigate back to the Site level, users can click the **Other Journals** link on the right navigation bar in the Journal Content section, under Browse.
