# Chapter 9: Reviewers

The Reviewer is invited by email to review a submission. The email includes the submission title and abstract, as well as the journal's URL and a username and password for the Reviewer to use to enter the journal. The Journal Manager has the option of setting up and using a review process that will send the submission as an email attachment to the Reviewer instead, along with an invitation to review. In this case, the Reviewer responds to the process by email. See Journal Management [Step Two](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs-2/en/step_two_policies).

Described here is the principal method for reviewing and ensuring complete records of the process, which involves the Reviewer conducting the Review on the journal's web site.
