# Estatísticas

If you publish articles with galley files in multiple languages (e.g.,PDF (English) and PDF (Francais)), the Articles Statistics page will show the title of the article in the language of the User Interface and show the total of file views regardless of language. The downloadable CSV View report will show detailed information about how many times each separate galley file has been viewed.
