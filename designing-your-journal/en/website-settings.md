# Website Settings

You can customize your websiteâ€™s look and feel by selecting one of the several available themes under Settings > Website > Appearance. For the list of available themes with description and demo pages see the [PKP Theming Guide - Themes](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-theming-guide/en/themes). You can change other settings that affect the appearance of your journal under Settings > Website > Appearance. See [Learning OJS 3 - Website Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#appearance) for more details on selecting a theme and configuring appearance settings.

With some themes you can change the colours under Website Settings > Appearance.  The colour settings will appear after you select the theme. To adjust it to match a specific colour, e.g., your logo, use a colour-picker tool (via browser developer tools or browser extension) and copy the hex value (looks like #1e6292) into the drop-down box. For details on how to identify elements on a page, see the section [Identifying Elements of CSS](./creating-stylesheet.md#identifying-elements).

In OJS you can use special plugins to add custom blocks to your site, including Twitter feeds, keyword clouds, and a list of most-read articles. [Learning OJS 3 - Website Settings](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#appearance) explains how to do this.
