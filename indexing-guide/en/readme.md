# Index Application Guide

Indexes and databases are online, searchable collections of information. Inclusion in relevant indexes is a valuable tool for increasing the “findability‟ of your journal and further developing your journal's readership. 

This guide will help editors with selecting the appropriate indexes for their journal and understanding an index's criteria for inclusion. It also provides guidance on setting up OJS to meet common requirements for inclusion, as well as detailed information about application and technical requirements for the following popular indexes: PubMed Central, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science.
