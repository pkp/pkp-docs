# Scopus 
Scopus is a source-neutral abstract and citation database for journals, book series, and conference series in the Health Sciences, Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, and Life Sciences literature, and one of the largest and most widely used indexes. Scopus is the largest indexer of global research content, with over 24,600 active titles, including 23,500+ peer-reviewed journals, 740+ books, and 300+ trade publications. Worldwide, Scopus is used by more than 5,000 academic, government and corporate institutions. Each subject area is curated by the Content Selection and Advisory Board (CSAB), an independent board of subject matter experts using quantitative and qualitative criterias. Journals accepted into Scopus must demonstrate the ability to maintain their quality status year over year.

## Application
Scopus journal selection criteria is a 2-stage process: 
1. Pre-submission and self-evaluation 
2. Scopus title evaluation 
   * Submission process 
   * Review decisions by the CSAB

### Stage 1: Pre-Submission and Self-Evaluation

All journals need to meet all of the minimum eligibility criteria. 

Scopus offers an optional [Pre-evaluation of Scopus](https://www.readyforscopus.com/) submission to check for technical and administrative criteria in order to boost the chances of the journal passing the formal evaluation and to avoid failure for reasons that could be easily identified. 

### Stage 2a: Scopus title evaluation: Submission Process

The review process can take 6-12 month and the average time is 6 months.

Sample journal content must be submitted with the completed application form.

### Stage 2b: Scopus title evaluation: Review decision by CSAB

Eligible titles are reviewed by subject experts of the Scopus CSAB following rigorous criteria. See the [Scopus website](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/how-scopus-works/content/content-policy-and-selection) for details about the criteria and process.

### Rejection and Embargo 

If a journal is rejected by Scopus, there is an embargo period after which the journal can apply again. This can range from 1 year to 5 years.

## Title re-evaluation
Journals accepted into Scopus are evaluated once a year to confirm they are maintaining a level of quality and meeting Scopus benchmarks. Benchmarks are detailed on the [Scopus website](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus/how-scopus-works/content/content-policy-and-selection).
