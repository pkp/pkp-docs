# Journal Administration

## Editorial board

An editorial board, also known as the editorial team, is a group of people who work on the publication and production of the journal. Members should have clearly defined roles, and each role is responsible for distinct stages of the process. For an introduction to the editorial process, see Module 1 Unit 5 of PKP School’s “[Becoming an Editor](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/courses/becoming-an-editor/)” series.

The [2016 Editorial Standards guide](https://www.editors.ca/node/11696), published by Editors Canada, contains information about editorial processes and conventions, as well as standards for structural editing, stylistic editing, copyediting and proofreading.

Look around at other journals or publishers for descriptions and examples of their boards (such as [Springer](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/editors/editorial-boards/32688) and [Wiley](https://authorservices.wiley.com/editors/editorial-office-guidelines/editorial-board.html)) to help with the creation of the journal’s board. [These slides](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/93452) provide a breakdown of the board structure at the University of Toronto Medical Journal, a student run journal founded in 1923. Including term lengths and how often the Board may meet, in addition to the responsibilities, is a good idea.

Another aspect for consideration would be the diversity of the board. Scholarly publishing traditionally has not been very diverse or inclusive, and there is a movement to change this. The Coalition for Diversity and Inclusion in Scholarly Communications has released a [statement of principles](https://c4disc.org/principles/) that can help guide you.

University Affairs published an [article in 2017](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/career-advice/career-advice-article/benefits-sitting-journals-editorial-board/) that discusses the benefits of participating on a journal’s board and can provide people with an idea of what to expect. Likewise, here is an article from [2016 by Devoney Looser](https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-Your-Journal-Editor-Works/236911?cid=rc_right) from the Chronicle of Higher Education that provides insight into the editorial process.

## Roles and responsibilities
