# Support for Your Journal

## Faculty

It is helpful to have a faculty member involved with the project. In addition to providing guidance and mentorship, faculty help maintain continuity when student editors graduate. They may serve as editors, reviewers, or advisors, or they may be responsible for higher-level activities such as strategic planning.

## Library

Developing a partnership with your library is one of the best ways to create a sustainable journal. Your library may be able to provide technical support, such as hosting, software support, or digital preservation services. Librarians may be able to assist with journal production or be interested in serving as editors, reviewers, managers, or advisors.

When contacting your library to learn whether they provide support for student publishing projects, get in touch with someone such as the Digital Initiatives Librarian or Scholarly Communications Librarian.

## Academic departments

Academic departments are a potential source of financial and non-financial support. Your journal might qualify for project grants or other funding. If your university offers practicums or independent study courses, find out if itâ€™s possible for editors to receive course credit for their work on the journal.

Other potential sources of support include student societies and unions and writing centres.
