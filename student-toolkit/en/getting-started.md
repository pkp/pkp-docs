# Getting Started

The infographic, [How to start an Open Access journal](http://hybridpublishing.org/files/2014/07/HOAJ-POSTER-final-web.pdf), outlines the things to consider when planning a new journal (see [appendix two](./appendix-2)). Similarly, Simon Fraser University has a similar [New Journal Checklist](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/dp/new-journal-checklist). Take some time to view it or similar resources in these early planning stages.

## PKP School

[PKP School](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/) offers a variety of free tutorials (accessible through a WordPress login) to help journals and their Boards get started. The following are great places to start:
