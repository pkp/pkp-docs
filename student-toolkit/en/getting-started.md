# Getting Started

The infographic, [How to start an Open Access journal (Appendix 2)](./appendix-2), outlines the things to consider when planning a new journal. Similarly, Simon Fraser University has a similar [New Journal Checklist](https://www.lib.sfu.ca/help/publish/dp/new-journal-checklist). Take some time to view it or similar resources in these early planning stages.

## PKP School
