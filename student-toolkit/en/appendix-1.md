# Appendix One: Why start a student journal?

## Benefits and challenges of publishing a student journal

Student journals rely on the volunteer labour of editors and peer reviewers. To attract and retain volunteers, it’s important to be clear about the time requirements, benefits, and potential challenges of participating in your journal. A good first step is to consider the value that the journal will personally bring to authors, editors, reviewers, readers, and other stakeholders. By thinking about these issues early on, you will be able to define goals and policies that will support the journal’s long term success.
