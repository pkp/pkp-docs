# Introduction

OJS, OMP, and other PKP software applications are multilingual. This allows the software interface to be available in different languages and allows journals and presses to publish in a variety of languages. The Public Knowledge Project aims to support English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese translations for each application. Community members have translated the software into many additional languages and we welcome contributions at any time.

This guide is for any user who wants to create or edit a translation of a PKP software application. It explains how languages and locales work, how to create new translations and add to existing translations using the translation tool Weblate, how to customize a translation on your local installation, how developers can localize their contributions, and how to work with the translation community.

Starting with OJS/OMP 3.2, PKP is using Weblate to manage and do translations of OJS and OMP. Previously PKP used the Translator Plugin and direct editing of the XML locale files. [The previous version of the PKP Translating Guide](/translating-guide/3.1/en/) explains how to translate with these tools. This guide explains how to use Weblate.
