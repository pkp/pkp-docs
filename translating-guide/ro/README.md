# PKP Translating Guide

The PKP Translating Guide is for users who want to create or edit a translation of a PKP software application. It explains how languages and locales work, how to create new translations and edit existing translations, how to customize a translation locally, and how to work with the translation community.

Starting with OJS/OMP/OPS 3.2, PKP is using Weblate to manage and do translations of OJS, OMP and OPS. Previously PKP used the Translator Plugin and direct editing of the XML locale files. [The previous version of the PKP Translating Guide](/translating-guide/3.1/en/) explains how to translate with these tools. This guide explains how to use Weblate.
