# Translating PKP Software: how to do it

To begin, it is helpful to understand how the [locale files are structured within an installation](2-2-xml-files).

There are two ways to edit/add to existing translations and to create new translations:

1. Work with the [Translator plugin](2-3-editing-existing#using-the-translation-plugin-tool)
2. Work directly with the [XML files containing the locale keys](2-3-editing-existing#creating-a-manual-translation).

If necessary, it is possible to [start a new translation from scratch](2-4-from-scratch).

Once you have made changes to your locale files, you may want to [share your work](2-5-sharing).
