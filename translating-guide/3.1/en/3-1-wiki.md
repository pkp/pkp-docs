# The PKP wiki and translations

The PKP wiki contains information on PKP development work. This is also important for translators who want to understand PKP's use of git and Github.

The wiki is being used to hold information on available locales. It credits translators and links to additional resources (like dictionaries, common phrases, journal examples).
