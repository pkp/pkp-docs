# PKP Translating Guide

PKP software includes popular applications like Open Journal Systems (OJS), Open Monograph Press (OMP), and Open Conference Systems (OCS). These applications can use multiple languages for interfaces, emails to users, etc. Open Journal Systems in particular has been translated to many languages. Some of these translations are not complete, and the applications get updated constantly.

This guide explains how to translate OJS and OMP version 3.1 and earlier and OCS. For OJS and OMP 3.2, we use a new translation tool which is explained in the [new version of the PKP Translating Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/translating-guide/en/). Please keep in mind that any translations you make to your OJS or OMP site using the older tools detailed in this guide may not be carried forward when you upgrade to OJS or OMP 3.2. If you would like to contribute to active current translation of the software, please use the new tools and [new guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/translating-guide/en/).

Community translators are helping with the important task of localizing software and documentation. They come from many different backgrounds; this documentation is supposed to help old and new contributors to explain how the translation processes work and how they can contribute. In addition, the documentation points to additional resources.
