# PKP Translating Guide

The PKP Translating Guide is for users who want to create or edit a translation of a PKP software application. It explains how languages and locales work, how to create new translations and edit existing translations, how to customize a translation locally, and how to work with the translation community.

Starting with OJS/OMP 3.2, PKP is using Weblate to manage and do translations of OJS and OMP. Previously PKP used the Translator Plugin and direct editing of the XML locale files. The previous version of the PKP Translating Guide explains how to translate with these tools. This guide explains how to use Weblate.
