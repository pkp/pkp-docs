# Translation Resources and Community

If your question is about how to use Weblate, there is excellent documentation available [on the Weblate website](https://weblate.org).

We maintain an [active forum on translations](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/c/translations); please post questions there and help build a knowledge base for other translators!

## Thanks

We deeply appreciate the efforts of our volunteer translators — maintaining a top-notch translation is difficult work! We hope you’ll enjoy seeing your translation used in the wild to cultivate and deliver research, much as we enjoy seeing our software used.

Special thanks to Marc Bria and the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona for their help with the Weblate application and consulting and advocacy on translation management.

Special thanks also to Marco Tullney for his tireless work managing translations for PKP software.

Thanks to all of the other contributors who participated in the conversation about translation tooling. It has been a [long and fruitful discussion](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/4779).

And as always, many thanks to all of the translators who make our international impact possible!
