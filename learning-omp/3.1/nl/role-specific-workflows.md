Press **Complete** followed by **Save and Continue**.

**Step 3: Catalog**

You will need to enter the following metadata regarding your manuscript. Items marked with the red asterisk are a mandatory part of the submission.

![The metadata form under the Catalog tab of the submission process.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_auth-subm-5.png)

Enter your manuscript’s Title, Subtitle, Abstract, List of Contributors, Chapters, Additional Refinements Subjects, and Keywords as applicable.

For the List of Contributors, you will need to fill in the required information: Name, Email, Country, and Contributor’s Role.

You will need to select who will be the principal contact for the submission and whether their name will appear in the browse list on the press.

Once you have completed the form, click **Save and Continue**.

**Step 4: Confirmation**

Once you have completed all the steps, click **Finish Submission**.

## Reviewer Workflow

Reviewer requests will appear in their user dashboard and in the taskbar. The request will have the Response and Review deadline.

![The expanded tasks menu in the dashboard, containing 3 pending reviews.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_rev-dash.png)

A reviewer can see more details regarding the request by clicking on the manuscript. The request submenu will have the general information regarding the submission, the review file, and additional submission details and review schedule.

The information in the **View All submission Details** will vary depending on your review policy.

![Review details, including files to review and due date.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_rev-invite.png)

The reviewer's option to accept or decline the review request will be at the bottom of this page. Once the reviewer accepts the request, they will have access to the remaining tabs.

The second tab will outline the press’ reviewer guidelines. The third tab will have the review file for download and text boxes for the reviewer to enter their comments to the author and editor or editor only. They can also upload files for the author or editor, as well as start discussions with the editor. The reviewer can submit the review at the bottom of this page. After the review has been submitted, the reviewer still has the option of starting a discussion with the editor.

## Editorial Workflow

### Manuscript Review

Once a manuscript has been submitted, the Editor will review the submission to determine its suitability.

The submitted manuscript will appear in the Editor’s **My Queue** or **Unassigned**. The Editor will select and download the Manuscript.

After reviewing the manuscript, the Editor can decide to Accept and Skip Review, Decline Submission, or send it through Peer Review. The Editor can either assign a Series Editor or undertake the review process themselves.

The assigned Editor will then decide whether they will send the manuscript for Internal or External Review.

### Internal vs. External Review

As an editor, you can choose to conduct an Internal Review followed by an External Review or choose to move straight to peer review; each of these optional stages involves its respective set of reviewers.

### Internal review

As an editor, you can initiate the internal review process for an assigned submission by choosing the Internal Review option on the monograph's Submission page. By sending the manuscript for Internal Review, other Editors can review this manuscript.

You will be prompted to select the submission files the author provided for inclusion in the review process, and you can optionally upload new files or revise existing files. Once you have selected the appropriate files, you can select to send the manuscript to review.

Once the Internal Review has been prompted on your dashboard, you will need to select reviewers by clicking **Add Reviewer** in your main menu subpanel.

![Highlighted location of the Add Reviewer button in the subpanel.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_assgn-rev.png)

You can select a reviewer from the reviewers in your journal, create a new reviewer, or enroll an existing reviewer from another journal within a multi-journal installation.

![The reviewer selection screen.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_assgn-rev2.png)

At this stage, reviewers associated with the press evaluate the submission. In an Open or Blind review, an editor can contact reviewers as well as revise their due dates by clicking the icon next to their names.

![The expanded reviewer details menu, including links to email the reviewer, view review history, etc.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_assgn-rev3.png)

You will be notified of completed reviews and can access the reviews by clicking the arrow beside the reviewer's name and selecting **Email Reviewer** in the Reviewers section.

Once all the reviews are in, you must make a decision on the submission. Options are the following:

* Request Revisions (in which case the author will be able to modify their submission information and/or upload revised submission files)
* Send to External Review (editor selects files to send to the external review process)
* Accept for Submission (at which point the submission will enter the Editorial stage, bypassing External Review)
* Decline Submission (at which point the submission will be archived and the author notified)

These selections are found on the right panel in the **Internal Review** menu.

### External review

The external review process can be initiated at the end of the internal review process by choosing the Send to External Review or at the time of initial triage. Similar to the Internal Review, you will be prompted to select the submission files the author provided for inclusion in the review process, and you can optionally upload new files or revise existing files. Once you have selected the appropriate files, you can select to send the manuscript to review.

Once the External Review has been prompted on your dashboard, you will need to select reviewers by clicking **Add Reviewer** in your main menu subpanel.

![Highlighted location of the Add Reviewer button in the subpanel.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_assgn-rev.png)

You can select a reviewer from the reviewers in your journal, create a new reviewer, or enroll an existing reviewer from another journal within a multi-journal installation.

At this stage, reviewers associated with the press evaluate the submission. In an Open or Blind review, an editor can contact reviewers as well as revise their due dates by clicking the icon next to their names.

Once the review has been completed you will be notified. As an editor, you can access the reviews by clicking on the reviewer's name in the Reviewers section.

All author, reviewer, and editor revision files are available from the Revisions section. Only documents included in this section will be available to be moved to later workflow stages.

Once all the reviews are in, you must make a decision on the submission. You may select one of the following:

* Request Revisions, in which case the author will be able to modify their submission information and/or upload revised submission files

* Decline Submission, at which point the submission will be archived and the author notified

* Accept Submission, at which point the submission will enter the Editorial stage

These selections are found on the right panel in the Internal Review menu.

## Copyediting Workflow

Please refer to the Copyediting section of [Learning OJS](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/editorial-workflow#copyediting).

## Production Workflow

Following the Copyediting stage, the manuscript enters the Production stage.

Whereas the production stage is generally initiated after the copyediting stage has been completed, the Editor may choose to add information as it becomes available earlier in the workflow process.

At the production stage you can review, edit, and finalize the information of the manuscript — including key metadata, abstract, category, contributors, chapters, submission type, permissions, the cover image, and identifiers and other metadata — by clicking **Catalog Entry**.

![Highlighted the location of the Catalog Entry link at the top of the production screen.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_catalog-entry.png)

You will also upload the publication format(s) in the Production stage. Various book formats including audio, digital, hardback, paperback/softback can be configured, and proofs can be uploaded for auditing and final editorial approval. Publication Formats will be explained in greater detail below.

Once the proofs are approved and the catalog information is checked and approved for publishing, the book is published online. **Terms for downloading monographs can be set.**

The production stage is used to create and manage publication formats **(e.g., Digital, Hardback, Paperback/ Softcover)**, final publication-ready versions of the submission, and the catalog itself. This process is **usually** managed by a production editor with the input and assistance of designers and proofreaders. Production Editors and other users can be assigned using the Participants menu.

All approved and copyedited submission files from the editorial stage are available in the Production Ready section, and additional files can be added if need be.

### Publication Formats

Books can be published on your public OMP press site in a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF, and EPUB. These files must be uploaded during the Production stage as **publication formats**. You can also create publication formats for physical hardcover and paperback copies of the book.

The publication files must be prepared outside of OMP by a typesetter, graphic designer, or layout editor. Once they are ready to be published, create a publication format and then upload the file.

To add a publication format:

1. Go to the Production stage of the submission
2. In the section **Publication Formats**, click **Add Publication Format**
3. In the box that appears, enter the file name (typically “PDF,” “HTML,” etc.) and fill out the other fields as necessary
4. When finished click OK

![Highlighted "Add publication format" link in the Publication Formats section.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_pub-format.png)

Now you will see the publication format listed. It should say it is **Awaiting Approval**.

![The "Awaiting Approval" status for a newly added format.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_pub-format2.png)

To upload the file:

1. Below the publication format, click **Change File**
2. Select the component type for the file
3. Upload the file
4. Click **Continue**
5. Review details and click **Continue** again
6. Click **Complete**

To add another format, follow the same steps.

You can upload multiple files for a single publication format, which you may wish to do when adding supplementary material or individual chapter files.

#### Add chapter files

If you want to upload individual chapter files, you can create a publication format called **Chapter Files** and then upload a file for each chapter under that publication format. The separate chapter files will then be available under the metadata on the published book page.

Another option is to create a separate publication format for each chapter, but if you do that there will be links to each chapter along the right side of the book page on your website, along with the main publication formats (EBOOK, PDF, etc.).

#### Approve publication formats and set terms

For a manuscript to appear in the public catalog, you must approve the submission's metadata for public display. Each publication format will have a two-step approval process.

![The "Awaiting Approval" checkbox and "Not Available" checkbox for an unreviewed format.](./assets/learning-omp_role-specific-workflow_pub-format-approve.png)

The first checkbox, **Awaiting Approval**, is for editors to sign off when the publication format's metadata is ready for publication.

The second checkbox, **Not Available**, is for approving the publication format for display to readers. Once this checkbox is toggled, any approved files will be shown to the user.

If a publication format has no approved files, it will not appear in the catalog.

In order for a digital edition of a book to be available for download, you must:
* Create a digital format (e.g., ebook) under the Production workflow stage
* Upload files to the format's proofreading step in the Production workflow stage
* Audit and approve all proofs
* Ensure that the submission and the format type are both marked as available in the catalog
* If charging a fee for the digital edition, ensure that you have a payment method selected under Management → Distribution * Process (either PayPal or manual payment)
* Finally, ensure that you configure the Direct Sales Availability & Pricing section for that particular format in the Catalog Entry, where you can either set a particular format as Open Access or optionally set a fee for purchase
