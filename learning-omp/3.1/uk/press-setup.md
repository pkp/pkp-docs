# Setting up and Maintaining Your Press

There are a number of components to your press found in the Settings menu on the left navigation bar. All of the site configuration options are under Settings > Press. The options you find here control every aspect of the press, including press information, how your press looks, workflow settings, and how the publication and distribution processes work. This section will go in-depth on your Press and Workflow Settings. Please refer to the [Learning OJS guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/) for information regarding the Website and Distribution that will be applicable in your OMP installation.

## Press Settings

In the Press Settings section, you can configure information about your press that will be displayed for readers, such as your press name, editorial team, and contact information. You can also set up and configure series and categories, which are used to display and organize your published monographs.

You can find the Settings in the left menu panel when you are logged in as a user with Press Manager permissions. This section contains most of the information that you provided when originally creating your press (and which can be modified at any time).

### Masthead

Enter and edit information about your press, including press name, editorial team, and about the press. All Masthead information will appear under pages in the About menu on your press website.

### Contact

This section contains the primary contact information you provided when originally creating your press and includes a technical support contact option. You can also add a mailing address. All contact information will appear on the Contact page under the About menu on your press website.

Series can be used to help organize your publications. A series represents a special set of books devoted to a theme or topic. Visitors will be able to search and browse the press by series. In the Series tab of your Press Settings, you can create, edit, and order the series that will appear on your press website.

Categories can be displayed as a browse block on your press site, and readers can select a category to view all books in that category.
