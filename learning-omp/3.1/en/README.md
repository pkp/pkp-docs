# Learning OMP 3: A User Guide to Open Monograph Press

Learning OMP 3 is a guide for how to use Open Monograph Press (OMP), an open source tool for managing and publishing monographs, edited volumes, and scholarly editions online. This guide is for Press Managers and Editors and explains how to manage roles and permissions, set up a press, publish monographs, and display them on your press website. 

This guide can be used alongside [Learning OJS 3](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/), which has information about how to use OMP that is common to both OMP and Open Journal Systems (OJS) – a similar open source software application for publishing scholarly journals.
