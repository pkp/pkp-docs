![](./assets/learning_omp-tools-import_export.png)

OMP provides a number of tools to import and export data into and out of your press. Please see [PKP’s Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) for information on how to use the Native XML Plugin and the Users XML Plugin. Please also note that the Quick Submit Plugin is not available for OMP.

To export using the ONIX 3.0 Monograph Export Plugin, you need to ensure that all of the fields are completed under Settings > Workflow > Production.

The Tab Delimited Content Import Plugin can only be used with the command line.

## Statistics

You can generate statistical reports for usage and reviews or create a custom report. For information on how to use and configure statistics in OMP see the [PKP Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/statistics).
