# Introduction

Open Monograph Press (OMP) is an open-source tool for managing and publishing monographs, edited volumes, and scholarly editions online. It is a highly flexible editor-operated book management and publishing system that can be downloaded for free and installed on most web servers. It has been designed to reduce the time and energy devoted to the clerical and managerial tasks associated with publishing books while improving the recordkeeping and efficiency of editorial processes. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of publishing through a number of innovations and includes clear and intuitive workflows for every aspect of the manuscript submission, review, editing, and production processes.

Among the many features of OMP is its ability to...

* Handle edited volumes, with different authors for each chapter;
* Involve editors, authors, reviewers, designers, indexers, and others in book production;
* See submissions through multiple rounds of both internal and external reviews;
* Utilize industry-standard ONIX for bookseller metadata requirements (e.g., Amazon);
* Create document libraries for submissions, recording contracts, permissions, etc.;
* Manage thumbnail covers in Catalog, as well as Spotlight features.

As OMP and OJS are similar software applications and share some of the same functions, this guide will refer users to sections of the OJS documentation that are shared. This guide is aimed at providing information specific to OMP.
