OMP provides a number of tools to import and export data into and out of your press. Please see [PKP’s Administrator’s Guide](/admin-guide/en/data-import-and-export) for information on how to use the Native XML Plugin and the Users XML Plugin. Please also note that the Quick Submit Plugin is not available for OMP.
