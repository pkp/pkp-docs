# Journal Policies and Workflows

This guide provides an overview of common journal policies and workflows and how they can be applied within OJS. Relevant documentation is linked throughout the document to instruct on how these practices can be employed in OJS. Those starting out may wish to review [the Basic Steps for Starting a New Journal Guide](/starting-a-journal/), which outlines steps to be taken and considerations when starting a new journal.
