# Session Management

Session management is provided by the Session model class, `SessionDAO`, and the `SessionManager` class (`classes/session/SessionManager.inc.php`).

While `Session` and `SessionDAO` manage database-persistent sessions for individual users, `SessionManager` is concerned with the technical specifics of sessions as implemented for PHP and Apache.
