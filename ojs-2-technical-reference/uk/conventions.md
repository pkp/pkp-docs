# Conventions

`Code samples`, `filenames`, `directories` and `class names` are presented in a courier typeface.

Square braces are used in code samples, filenames, URLs, and class names to indicate a sample value: for example, `[anything]Handler.inc.php` can be interpreted as any file name ending in Handler.inc.php.

The URL http://www.mylibrary.com used in many examples is intended as a fictional illustration only.
