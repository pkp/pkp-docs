# Article Uploads
Using the QuickSubmit plugin, fill out the publication metadata for the article you are uploading.  When you reach the bottom of the form, pick the issue you just published from the "schedule for publication" drop-down. In the "published" field, just below that puts the actual publication date of the article (required).

You may wish to assign your articles to a “future issue” to review before publication. However, doing so will mean that any article added to a future issue will overwrite any dates you’ve entered via the QuickSubmit plugin and *automatically record the current date as the publication date*. 

Repeat Step 4 until you have uploaded all the articles that belong to the issue.
