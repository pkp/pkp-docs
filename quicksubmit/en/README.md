# Introduction

The QuickSubmit plugin can be used to upload back issue content into OJS. One problem that users come across when using this tool is the incorrect publication date that gets associated with uploading your content. 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on uploading “back issue” content with the original publication dates using the QuickSubmit plugin available in OJS. 

If your content has been previously published with special cases such as with a DOI, published under a different prefix, or published with no contributor, please review the relevant section before beginning the steps outlined below.
