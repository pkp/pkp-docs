# Set up a PayPal sandbox account

To get started, test the plugin with the PayPal sandbox account feature. Switch to the real PayPal website only after testing that the sandbox account interactions with your journal are working as expected. This section describes the sandbox setup process.

Although the sandbox website is a great feature, PayPal's names are a bit confusing. PayPal has two types of accounts that live on the sandbox website. You should distinguish between the developer account, and pretend-PayPal accounts. You first create one and only one developer account. This developer account in turn allows you to create pretend-PayPal accounts with monopoly money. When logging into the sandbox website, you may log on either into your real developer account, or into one of the many pretend-PayPal accounts that you have created. To get started, go to [https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=\_onboarding-list&getStarted=true&gt;](https://www.sandbox.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_onboarding-list&getStarted=true&gt).

1. Sign up for the business account
2. Create a New Account. This account has nothing to do with your real PayPal account. It is also not even the test account that you will be using to test PayPal with your site. Instead, it is the PayPal developer account that will allow you in turn to create pretend-PayPal accounts. It is these pretend-PayPal accounts that you will use to test PayPal interaction with your journal.
3. In the sandbox sign up, you should give your real information. It is a real account, used to develop the PayPal interaction. Describe your business, presumably your journal. On the next page, give your real Business Owner Contact Information.
4. After you log into this brand-new sandbox account, you can begin to create test accounts. You should probably create one seller pretend-PayPal account for your journal, and a few pretend-PayPal accounts for different buyers \(journal subscribers, donors, etc\). You can also give these accounts bank balances, login accounts, etc.

After you have created each pretend-PayPal account, you can easily log in to any one of these pretend-PayPal accounts via a nice menu choice from your sandbox developer accounts, which makes this easy. After you are logged into your pretend-PayPal account, you can do everything a real PayPal user can do. For example, you can verify your pretend-PayPal account. \(If the site asks for verification \(which the real PayPal does by depositing two small transactions into your account\), you can provide any dollar amount you wish.\)

At this point, you should be all set to simulate the PayPal side of your interactions. now skip to Configuring OJS or Configure OCS below.
