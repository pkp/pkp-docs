# Project Information

PKP and Crossref collaborate to help publishers and journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS) take better advantage of Crossref services. In 2014, PKP became a Sponsoring Organization of Crossref, providing improved Crossref integration and overall support for the service. Additionally, PKP can now act as a sponsor representative for OJS journals wishing to apply for Crossref membership and is, in some cases, able to waive fees.

## DOI and Associated Metadata Export

PKP is continually working with Crossref to improve the level of overall DOI export support provided within OJS. OJS has included a simple manual export plugin for several years; this plugin has supplemented with the following features:

- automatic DOI deposit to Crossref on article publication (2.4.5);
- inclusion of other article metadata in the Crossref deposit, including author ORCID iDs; article abstracts; and more (OJS 2.4.5);
- inclusion of FundRef funding data (OJS 3.1.2-1);
- inclusion of references (OJS 3.1.2-1);
- improved use of Crossref API (OJS 3.1.2-1);
- support for Similarity Check service;
- also, regular review for improved user experience.

## Future Development Plans and Milestones

Crossref and PKP have formed a working group to review existing integrations and metadata. Stay tuned to the PKP blog for further announcements and news regarding Crossref.
