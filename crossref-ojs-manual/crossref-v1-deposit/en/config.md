# How to Configure OJS for Crossref XML Export

## Configuring OJS 2.4.x

See the [OJS 2.4.x Crossref Plugin Guide](../../../crossref-ojs2-manual/en/configManual.html).

## Configuring OJS 3.0, 3.1

Setup for the Crossref Export Plugin in these versions is the same as detailed in the [OJS 3.1.2 Crossref Plugin Guide](../../3.1.2/en/config.html)

## Depositing DOIs with Crossref via XML Export

The XML Export generated by the Crossref XML plugin can be used to manually deposit your content into Crossref via the [Crossref Administrative Console](https://doi.crossref.org/servlet/useragent).

### Exporting Crossref XML file

### OJS 3.1.x

In OJS 3.1.x this can be completed by a user with the Journal Manager and/or Journal Editor role.

* To export individual articles, click the boxes for each article you want to export
* Once you have selected the issue(s) or article(s) click 'Download XML'
* Save a copy of the file on your local desktop
* Navigate to [Crossref’s metadata quality check](https://www.crossref.org/02publishers/parser.html) and upload your file here first to check for any validation errors.
* Login to your [Crossref Administration Console](https://doi.crossref.org/servlet/useragent)
