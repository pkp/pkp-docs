# PKP as Sponsoring Organization

Since 2014, Public Knowledge Project have served as a [Crossref Sponsoring Organization](https://www.crossref.org/community/sponsors/). This means PKP can act as a membership representative for PKP Publishing Services' "enterprise" clients _or_ eligible publishers/organizations/journals using Open Journal Systems (OJS) who are not able to join directly due to financial, administrative, or technical barriers.

## Eligibility

At present, PKP supports two kinds of sponsored memberships:

1. Applicant organizations/journals from countries on [Crossref’s Global Equitable Membership](https://www.crossref.org/gem/) list that use OJS.
    - OJS version must be 3.1.2 or higher.
    - Organization/journal must have valid mailing and billing addresses.
    - Organization/journal must pass an evaluation process confirming accurate information against their application.
    - Organization/journal must be from a country on the [eligible countries](https://www.crossref.org/gem/) list.
    - Journal revenue **must fall under tier 1 of the Crossref membership fee structure of < $1 million USD annually**.
2. Journals at the [“Enterprise” hosting tier with PKP Publishing Services](https://pkp.sfu.ca/hosting-services/hosting/journals/).
    - Any OJS version supported.
    - Journal must have a valid mailing address.
    - Journal revenue **must fall under tier 1 of the Crossref membership fee structure of < $1 million USD annually**.

Crossref will review the eligibility criteria annually and note any changes to sponsoring organizations. The IDA reviews their criteria list annually, and while it is not common to have lots of movement, Crossref will notify members whose country moves on or off the IDA list of any upcoming fees (or the removal of them) so they can plan and budget. For further eligibility criteria and any other information, [contact us](mailto:pkp.contact@gmail.com).
