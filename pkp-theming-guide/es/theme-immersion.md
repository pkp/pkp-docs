# Immersion Theme

Immersion emphasizes the reading experience and offers bold design options such as a full-width header image and per-section color choices. The serif typeface, Spectral, conveys a strong artistic personality and is paired with the crisp functionality of Roboto, a sans-serif typeface.

[This OJS site](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs3/demo/index.php/immersion) demonstrates the Immersion theme.

This theme allows you to display a full-width image in the header. When used appropriately, the image and color options can provide a striking aesthetic that will stand out from other journals. This effect may work best for arts and culture journals which want to present a more ambitious visual profile.

Installation and configuration instructions are available in the theme's [style guide](https://github.com/pkp/immersion/blob/main/README.md).
