# Default Theme

The default theme that ships with OJS 3.0+ and OMP 1.2+ is designed to work great for a broad range of users. It employs a simple, straightforward design style that's easy to tailor to fit your needs and ensures your content is easy-to-access no matter what.

[This OJS site](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs3/demo/index.php/demojournal) demonstrates the Default theme.

The default typography uses fonts from Google's [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) family, specially-designed to improve visual harmony across as many languages as possible. A wide variety of character sets are available from [Google's web font repository](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans?selection.family=Noto+Sans).

The Default Theme has deliberately chosen a simple, no-fuss layout with a neutral color palette. This makes it easier for your brand to stand out with just a few simple changes to the color and typography in use.

As of OJS/OMP/OPS 3.3, the Default Theme has been externally audited for accessibility and adheres to best practices like colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and form/link focus. Note that changes made to the theme may impact accessibility.

The simple structure of the Default Theme makes it easier to extend with [Child Themes](child-themes.md). A large set of [LESS variables](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/main/plugins/themes/default/styles/variables.less) can be adjusted to override font sizes, colors, borders, responsive breakpoints and more.
