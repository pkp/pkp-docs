# PKP Theming Guide

The PKP Theming Guide is an introduction to building custom themes for Open Journal Systems 3.0+ and OMP 1.2+. It is written for web developers who wish to tailor the look and feel of their journal or press with custom PHP, HTML and CSS code.

This guide is a living document that will grow and adapt over time. It is based on initial work undertaken during the PKP Sprint Fall 2016, and benefits from feedback and contributions from people like you.
