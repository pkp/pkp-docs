# DOI Troubleshooting

## I activated the DOI Plugin, but no DOIs are being assigned to my publications.

## I manually assigned a DOI to a publication in OMP but it's not appearing on the publication's page on my website.

Check that there is a publication date in the catalog entry for the PDF. DOIs can also only be registered if they have a publication date.

**How do I know if my DOIs have errors or failures?**

The registration agency you use should provide you with regular error reports which describe broken DOIs.

## What should I do if my journal URL changes?

If you have a journal which changes the URL syntax, a best practice is to re-register all DOIs for that journal to ensure the URLs are up-to-date with the registration authority.

## How do I assign DOIs to a large number of publications at once?
