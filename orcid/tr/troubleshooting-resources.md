# Troubleshooting

## Make sure your plugin is up to date

Most troubleshooting issues can be resolved by upgrading the ORCID plugin. If you run into any issues, try upgrading the plugin first. You should also check periodically to make sure your ORCID plugin remains up to date.

To update the plugin:

1. Go to Settings > Website > Plugins > Plugin Gallery
2. Scroll to the ORCID plugin listing
3. Check to make sure the note next to the ORCID plugin says “up to date”. If there is an update available, install the update by clicking "Update".

## Authors receive ORCID invitation links but cannot login

Ensure  that your ORCID plugin is actually configured and not just enabled; don't enable it unless you are ready to configure it.

## ORCID is configured but authors who click the link receive an error message

Check to ensure that authors are using the current link and not a previous link from the sandbox. If you are on OJS 3.2 it may also be this bug in ORCID email template for authors - [https://github.com/pkp/orcidProfile/issues/122](https://github.com/pkp/orcidProfile/issues/122) (which is resolved in 3.2-1-3 and 3.3)
