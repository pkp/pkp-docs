# Learning OPS 3.3: A User Guide to Open Preprint Systems

Learning OPS 3 is a guide for how to use Open Preprint Systems (OPS), an open source application for managing the posting of preprint research papers. This guide is for Server Managers and Moderators and explains how to set up a preprint server, develop policies and workflows, moderate and post preprints, and display them on your server website.

This guide can be used alongside [Learning OJS 3](/learning-ojs), which has information about how to use OPS that is common to both OPS and Open Journal Systems (OJS) – a similar open source software application for publishing scholarly journals.
