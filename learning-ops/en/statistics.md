# Statistics
This chapter of the Learning OPS 3.2 provides a general overview of statistics available in Open Preprint Server (OPS). For more detailed information on statistics and usage guidelines, please see the Statistics chapter on the [PKP Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/statistics).

There are a number of identified improvements that will be made towards statistics specific to Server Preprints for future releases.


## Preprints
The Preprints section provides a visual display as well as a table format of preprint activity.  The visual graphic can be changed from Monthly or Daily view. While the table format will allow you to filter the Total in ascending or descending order. As well as changed to view Abstract and File activity.

## Editorial Activity
