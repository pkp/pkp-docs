# Content Discovery

OPS supports a number of ways to make the content on your Server discoverable to your readers. Most of which are built in functionality.

## Home Page

### Search by Category

If categories have been created, users will be able to search by these from your Servers homepage.

If subcategories have been created, users will be able to search these by clicking on the parent category.

### Highlights

Highlights allow you to feature images and information on your preprint server home page. Use this to draw attention to a Call for Preprints or to highlight a particular post. If you add multiple highlights, they will be added to a carousel display that rotates between highlights. **This feature may not work for all themes**.
