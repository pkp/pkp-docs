## Step 1

In **Step 1** you will provide preliminary information about your submission.

To begin select the appropriate section for your submission \(e.g., article, review, etc.\). If you aren’t sure which section is appropriate, make your best guess.

Read and agree to the statements in the submission checklist by checking each box. Include any comments for the editor, read the journal’s privacy statement, and then click the **Save and Continue** button to move to **Step 2**.

## Step 2

On **Step 2**, a window will open allowing you to upload your submission file.

First, you MUST select an Article Component. This lets the system know whether the file is the body of the manuscript, an image, a data set, etc. **This must be selected before your file will upload**.

Once you’ve made that selection, you can then upload your first file. It is important to note that you can only upload **one** file at a time. Additional files can be uploaded later in the process. Typically, this first file will be the body of your manuscript. Hit the **Continue** button once the file uploads.

After uploading the file, you will be asked to review the name of the file. Use the Edit link to make any changes.

Click the **Continue** button.

Next, you have the option to repeat the process to upload additional files \(e.g., a data set or an image\).

Once you have finished uploading all of your files, click **Complete**; this will close the upload window.
