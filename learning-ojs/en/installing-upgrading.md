# Installing and Upgrading

OJS 3 is a PHP web application with standardized install and upgrade processes. These processes are kept as simple as possible, though some general systems administration experience is recommended.

Up to date OJS system requirements, as well as installation, upgrade, and configuration instructions can be found in the following locations:

* in the package you downloaded from the [OJS download page](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ojs_download/) (look in the `docs/` directory);
* directly in the online [README](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/README) or [UPGRADE](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/UPGRADE) documents;
* in the PKP [Administrator's Guide](/admin-guide).

For those who want to install from source via Git, instructions can be found directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/ojs).

## Download

OJS can be downloaded from the [Public Knowledge Project web site](https://pkp.sfu.ca).
