**Additional Site and Article Access Restrictions**: Choose from these options to limit access.

> Keep in mind that while requiring registration to read open access content can be convenient for your tracking, it can dissuade some people from reading your content. Use with care.

**User Registration**: This option allows you to determine whether users can create their own accounts or must be enrolled by a Journal Manager.

> Allowing users to register themselves, but only into Author, Reviewer, or Reader roles, is a good choice.
