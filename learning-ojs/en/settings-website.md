## Appearance

### Theme

The theme determines the overall design or layout of your site. Several different theme options are available and you can try them out without affecting your site's content or configuration.

First you can ensure that all available themes have been enabled on your site.

2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save.
3. The theme may have additional sub-themes or configuration options available. To make these appear, refresh the page in your browser.
4. If you select a different sub-theme or change the colour scheme or other design features, click Save at the bottom of the page again.
5. Open your site's home page in a new tab or window of your browser to see how the site looks with the new theme or sub-theme and with different configuration options.
6. If you do not see the changes appear on your site, you may need to clear the cache under the Administration menu.

If you would like to make minor changes to your site's design and layout, you can upload a **Journal Stylesheet** in Website Settings > Appearance > Advanced.

Remember to hit **Save** to record any changes.

To remove these fields and their contents from displaying publicly on the website's user interface, deselect the Information Block in Website Settings > Appearance > Sidebar Management.

### Languages

OJS is multilingual, which means that the interface, emails, and published content can be available in multiple languages on a single site or journal. When you install OJS, you can select one or more languages for your site.

Under Website Settings > Languages you can see a list of languages or locales installed on your site and configure how the languages are used in your journal. Additional languages can be installed on your site by an Administrator – see [Chapter 4](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/site-administration) for details.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-lang.png)

- **Primary Locale**: One language must be set as the primary locale, which means the language the journal appears in by default.

- **UI**: If you want the journal’s interface to be available in other languages, select them here.

- **Forms**: This will enable all selected languages to be available when filling in online forms. This will allow metadata to be added in selected languages in the Publication tab.

- **Submission**: If you want authors to be able to make submissions in other languages, select them here. This will allow authors to add metadata in selected languages when uploading their submission.

If enabling multiple languages to appear in the UI, make sure that in Website Settings > Appearance > Sidebar Management the Language Toggle Block is selected to make that feature available to users.

### Navigation

This section allows you to configure your navigation menus, such as including new links.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-navmenu.png)

- **Navigation Menus**: Configure the User Menu and/or the Primary Menu.

Some menu item types will only be displayed under certain conditions. For example, the Login menu item type will link to your login page, but it will only appear in the menu when your website visitor is logged out. Similarly, the Logout menu item type will only appear when a website visitor is logged in.

When you assign a Menu Item with display conditions to a Menu, you will see an icon of an eye with a slash through it. You can click that icon to learn more about when it will be displayed or hidden.

- **Navigation Menu Items**: These are programmed links you can add to either menu above. If you wish to add a link to the Primary Menu \(e.g., "Our Society"\), add it here using the _Add Item_ link.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-navmenu-add.png)

It will now appear in the list of Navigation Menu Items. Next, go to the desired Navigation Menu \(e.g., Primary\), use the blue arrow to reveal the options, and choose Edit. You can now drag and drop it from Unassigned Menu Items to Assigned Menu Items and into the appropriate location on the menu.

All of the plugins listed here are available in your OJS installation. Check the Enable link to use them.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-plugins.png)

You will notice that some plugins are required for the system and cannot be disabled.

Click the blue arrow next to the plugin name to reveal links to Delete, Upgrade, or Configure settings for the plugin.

### Plugin Gallery

The Plugin Gallery provides access to externally-created plugins, that may not be included in your OJS installation, but are available for download and activation. Only an Administrator user can install a new plugin.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-plugins-gallery.png)

Selecting the plugin title will provide additional details, including the author, status, description, and compatibility.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-plugins-gallery-hypo.png)

### External Plugins

Sometimes new plugins or plugins that are developed by folks outside of PKP will not appear in the Plugin Gallery and you need to install them separately.
1. Download the tar.gz file of the plugin from its repository under the Releases tab.
2. Go to Installed Plugins tab.
3. At top right, click Upload a New Plugin.
4. Upload the plugin file.
5. When it has finished uploading, click Save. Give it some time to install.

If upload fails you may get an error message that says, “The uploaded plugin archive does not contain a folder that corresponds to the plugin name.” Usually this means you have to change the name of the plugin folder inside the zipped folder to a more simple name. For example, change “translator-ojs-3_0_0-0” to “translator.”

Remember to hit Save to record the change.

### Content Enhancement and Discovery Plugins

OJS 3 has a number of plugins that you can enable to help enhance the user experience and discoverability of your content and journal. This section will outline the different plugins available in OJS and how to configure and use them.

As some of the plugins below are 3rd party plugins, it may require that you download the zip file from GitHub and upload it to your journal. For general information on plugins and how to install and enable plugins, please see [Learning OJS 3 - Plugins](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#plugins).

Please note that as PKP does not maintain 3rd party plugins, we cannot guarantee that it will work with your version of OJS.

#### AddThis Plugin

[AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) permits easy social media sharing by integrating tools for several platforms into a compact set of configurable buttons. The plugin integrates AddThis into OJS/OMP for quick sharing of published content.

```
7. Additional custom timeline parameters can be added if you want, e.g:
