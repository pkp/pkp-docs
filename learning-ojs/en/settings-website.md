# Website Settings

The Website Settings allow you to configure how your journal's website looks and operates. It consists of 3 main tabs for Appearance, Setup, and Plugins.

![OJS dashboard view of website settings menu.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-appearance.png)

## Appearance

[![Video demonstrating Appearance settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/4i5uRgzFHfg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/4i5uRgzFHfg)

### Theme

The theme determines the overall design or layout of your site. Several different theme options are available and you can try them out without affecting your site's content or configuration.

First you can ensure that all available themes have been enabled on your site.

1. Go to the Plugins tab under Website Settings.
2. Scroll to the bottom and find Theme Plugins.
3. Check the box next to each plugin to enable it.

You can also look for additional themes in the Plugin Gallery and install and enable those.

Now that you have all available themes, return to the Appearance tab to try out different themes.

1. Under Theme you will see a drop-down list of themes. Select one.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click Save.
3. The theme may have additional sub-themes or configuration options available. To make these appear, refresh the page in your browser.
4. If you select a different sub-theme or change the colour scheme or other design features, click Save at the bottom of the page again.
5. Open your site's home page in a new tab or window of your browser to see how the site looks with the new theme or sub-theme and with different configuration options.
6. If you do not see the changes appear on your site, you may need to clear the cache under the Administration menu.

As of OJS/OMP/OPS 3.3, the **Default Theme** has been externally audited for accessibility and adheres to best practices like colour contrast, keyboard navigation, and form/link focus. [PKP Accessibility Statement](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/accessibility-statement/) contains further details.

If you would like to make minor changes to your site's design and layout, you can upload a **Journal Stylesheet** in Website Settings > Appearance > Advanced.

- **Typography**: Quickly choose the fonts for your journal. This option may or may not be available depending on the selected theme.

- **Colour**: Quickly change the colour of your journal's header. This option may or may not be available depending on the selected theme.

- **Journal Summary**: Check this off to show the journal summary on the homepage. You can add your journal summary under Journal Settings > Masthead. This option may or may not be available depending on the selected theme.

- **Header Background Image**: Check this off if you if you want the uploaded homepage image to be shown as the header background.

For further theme customization options, consult the [Designing Your Journal](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/designing-your-journal/en/) guide. Note that changes made to the themes may impact journal accessibility.

### Setup

Where you can upload images (logo, thumbnail, homepage) to your sites main page, enter footer information, and configure your sidebar menu.

- **Journal thumbnail**: Upload a small logo or image representative of the journal that will be used in lists of journals on this OJS installation. This will only be used on OJS installations with multiple journals.

- **Homepage Image**: Uploading an image here will will place it on your journal's home page.

- **Page Footer**: Enter any images, text or HTML code that you'd like to appear at the bottom of your website.

- **Sidebar**: This allows you to move different blocks in or out of the sidebar in the reader interface. You can also create a custom block using the [Custom Block plugin](./settings-website.md#custom-block-plugin)

### Advanced

Where you can upload your journal stylesheet, Favicon, and Additional Content.

- **Journal Style Sheet**: Use this to upload a unique style sheet for your journal. Instructions on modifying the CSS are available in the [Designing Your Journal: Creating a Stylesheet](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/designing-your-journal/en/creating-stylesheet) guide.

If you would like to make more significant changes to the design or give your site an entirely unique look, you can develop your own theme or child theme. Instructions are available in the [PKP Theming Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-theming-guide/en/).

- **Journal Favicon**: Add a [favicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon) to display in the reader's browser address bar.

Hit **Save** to record your changes.

## Setup

### Information

[![Video demonstrating Information settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/48qU18uqqkg/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/48qU18uqqkg)

Use these fields to modify the text in the For Readers, For Authors, For Librarians pages on the journal website.

![OJS dashboard view of Information menu with boiler plate text in the fields for readers and for authors.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-info.png)

Remember to hit **Save** to record any changes.

To remove these fields and their contents from displaying publicly on the website's user interface, deselect the Information Block in Website Settings > Appearance > Sidebar Management.

### Languages

[![Video demonstrating Language settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VU5kAPOqNPc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VU5kAPOqNPc)

OJS is multilingual, which means that the interface, emails, and published content can be available in multiple languages and authors can make submissions in one or more languages on a single site or journal. When you install OJS, you can select one or more languages for your site.

Under Website Settings > Languages you can see a list of languages or locales installed on your site and configure how the languages are used in your journal. Consider carefully how you want to configure and use languages in your journal because significant problems can occur if you change the settings later.

![OJS dashboard view of Languages menu with English and French options, English option selected as primary locale.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-lang.png)

- **Primary Locale**: One language must be set as the primary locale, which means the language the journal appears in by default.

- **UI**: If you want the journal’s front end and back end interface to be available in other languages, select them here. Enabling a language for the UI will allow users to select the language of the application interface. For example, buttons, page titles, and on-screen messages will be in the user's selected language.

- **Forms**: This will enable all selected languages to be available when filling in online forms. Enabling a language for forms will allow text boxes to support multilingual data entry, including the Publication tab for submissions. For example, configuration settings and metadata can be entered in multiple languages.

- **Submission**: If you want authors to be able to make submissions in other languages, select them here. This will allow authors to select a language when they make a submission and add metadata in selected languages when uploading their submission.

Additional languages can be installed on your site by an Administrator – see [Chapter 4](./site-administration) for details.

If enabling multiple languages to appear in the UI, make sure that in Website Settings > Appearance > Sidebar Management the Language Toggle Block is selected to make that feature available to users.

### Navigation

[![Video demonstrating Navigation settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OJL-XEgzhYU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OJL-XEgzhYU)

This section allows you to configure your navigation menus, such as including new links.

![OJS dashboard view of Navigation Menu with user and primary menus and an option to add or edit navigation menu items.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-navmenu.png)

- **Navigation Menus**: Configure the User Menu and/or the Primary Menu.

Some menu item types will only be displayed under certain conditions. For example, the Login menu item type will link to your login page, but it will only appear in the menu when your website visitor is logged out. Similarly, the Logout menu item type will only appear when a website visitor is logged in.

When you assign a Menu Item with display conditions to a Menu, you will see an icon of an eye with a slash through it. You can click that icon to learn more about when it will be displayed or hidden.

- **Navigation Menu Items**: These are programmed links you can add to either menu above. If you wish to add a link to the Primary Menu (e.g., "Our Society"), add it here using the _Add Item_ link.

![Add item screen with item title and remote URL filled out.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-navmenu-add.png)

It will now appear in the list of Navigation Menu Items. Next, go to the desired Navigation Menu (e.g., Primary), use the blue arrow to reveal the options, and choose Edit. You can now drag and drop it from Unassigned Menu Items to Assigned Menu Items and into the appropriate location on the menu.

![Primary navigation area with a list of assigned and unassigned menu items.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-navmenu-add-nav.png)

Hit Save to record the change.

### Announcements

[![Video demonstrating Navigation settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/OmiDQGX4SGs/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OmiDQGX4SGs)

This section allows you to create and display news announcements on the journal's website.

![OJS dashboard view of Announcements menu with an option to enable and display announcements.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-announce.png)

- **Announcements**: Check this off if you want to have announcements in your website
  - **Introduction**: Enter any general information you would like to appear on your announcements page.
  - **Display on Homepage**: Enter the number of announcements to be displayed on the homepage. If this is left blank, no announcements will be displayed.

Once the Announcements setting is enabled, click "Save." An "Announcements" menu item now appears in the main navigation on the left hand side. Click on this menu item and select "Add Announcement." Here you can include the title of the announcement, a short description and / or full text of the announcement, and an (optional) expiry date. If you wish to send an email notification to all users (who have not opted out of email notifications), select "Send notification email to all registered users." The announcement should now appear on an "Announcements" tab on the public-facing journal site.

![OJS 3.3 Announcements menu enabled in the sidebar with an option to add and edit announcements.](./assets/learning-ojs3.3-settings-website-announcements.png)

[![Video demonstrating other website settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/3vAR6lu-4DE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/3vAR6lu-4DE)

### Privacy Statement

Enter the privacy statement you want to appear on your site.

### Date and Time

This option allows for the configuration of different format for dates and times for each journal and locale, which could previously only be set up in the 'config.inc.php' file. Note that the `config.inc.php` file can still be used to set the time and format across multiple journals, and the settings for the primary locale will be the default for other locales, unless otherwise configured.  A custom format can be entered using the [special format characters](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php#refsect1-function.strftime-parameters).

![OJS 3.3 Date and Time menu with an option to select long and short date formats.](./assets/learning-ojs3.3-date-and-time-setup.png)

## Plugins

[![Video demonstrating plugin settings](https://img.youtube.com/vi/PMAsXY_tLMU/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/PMAsXY_tLMU)

Use this page to see all of the installed plugins and find new plugins.

### Installed Plugins

All of the plugins listed here are available in your OJS installation. Check the Enable link to use them.

![OJS dashboard view of Plugins menu with the tab for installed plugins selected.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-plugins.png)

You will notice that some plugins are required for the system and cannot be disabled.

Click the blue arrow next to the plugin name to reveal links to Delete, Upgrade, or Configure settings for the plugin.

### Plugin Gallery

The Plugin Gallery provides access to externally-created plugins, that may not be included in your OJS installation, but are available for download and activation. Only an Administrator user can install a new plugin.

![OJS dashboard view of Plugins menu with the tab for plugin gallery selected.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-plugins-gallery.png)

Selecting the plugin title will provide additional details, including the author, status, description, and compatibility.

![Hypothes.is plugin selected in the plugin gallery shows that it is installed and up-to-date.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-web-plugins-gallery-hypo.png)

### External Plugins

Sometimes new plugins or plugins that are developed by folks outside of PKP will not appear in the Plugin Gallery and you need to install them separately.

1. Download the tar.gz file of the plugin from its repository under the Releases tab.
2. Go to Installed Plugins tab.
3. At top right, click Upload a New Plugin.
4. Upload the plugin file.
5. When it has finished uploading, click Save. Give it some time to install.

If upload fails you may get an error message that says, “The uploaded plugin archive does not contain a folder that corresponds to the plugin name.” Usually this means you have to change the name of the plugin folder inside the zipped folder to a more simple name. For example, change “translator-ojs-3_0_0-0” to “translator.”

Remember to hit Save to record the change.

### Content Enhancement and Discovery Plugins

OJS 3 has a number of plugins that you can enable to help enhance the user experience and discoverability of your content and journal. This section will outline the different plugins available in OJS and how to configure and use them.

As some of the plugins below are 3rd party plugins, it may require that you download the zip file from GitHub and upload it to your journal. For general information on plugins and how to install and enable plugins, please see [Learning OJS 3 - Plugins](./settings-website#plugins).

Please note that as PKP does not maintain 3rd party plugins, we cannot guarantee that it will work with your version of OJS.

#### AddThis Plugin

[AddThis](https://www.addthis.com/) permits easy social media sharing by integrating tools for several platforms into a compact set of configurable buttons. The plugin integrates AddThis into OJS/OMP for quick sharing of published content.

#### Custom Header Plugin

The Custom Header plugin can be used to add custom JavaScript to a header or block. JavaScript is often required to link your site with outside services but cannot be added directly to a field for security reasons.

The plugin can be installed from the Plugin Gallery.

**Example: Use the Custom Header plugin to add a Twitter feed to your sidebar**

You can add a Twitter feed for your journal, press, or organization to the sidebar of OJS or OMP.

<a class="twitter-timeline" "data-tweet-limit="3" ...
````
8. Click **Save**

Finally, you have to add the custom block you just created to your sidebar.

1. Go to Website Settings > Appearance and scroll down to **Sidebar Management**
2. You should see the Twitter block under **Unselected**
3. Drag and drop the block over to **Sidebar**. You can drag and drop all your blocks in the desired order.
