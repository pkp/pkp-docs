# Workflow Settings

The Workflow Settings allow you to configure various parts of the journal's editorial workflow. The workflow setting has 4 main tabs.

## Submission

Use this section to configure the submission process.

### Metadata

This section determines what types of metadata will be collected during the submission process, such as keywords and references.

### Components

Components are the file types authors may upload to the site. Typically, one file will be the article text, and others can include interview transcripts, data, images, etc. The components available for the author to choose from when making their submission are listed here.

Using the links provided, you can change the **Order** of the components \(how they will be listed to the submitting author\), **Add a Component** \(if something you need is not included by default -- e.g., Video\), or **Restore the Defaults** \(if someone has made too many modifications and you just want to reset everything\).

#### Edit Component

You can also edit each component by selecting the blue arrow to the left of the component name. This will reveal an Edit link and a Delete link.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-comp-edit.png)

- **Name**: This is the name of the component, as presented to the author.

- **Options**: Choose how the files associated with this component will be treated and displayed. Anything that is marked as a Dependent file will not be published.

- **File Type Grouping**: Determine whether this component is associated with the submission document, artwork, or is a supplementary file.

- **Key**: Optional short symbol for the component.

### Checklist

In the Submission Preparation Checklist, Authors must check off that they agree with each item on this list. Use the _Order_ link to change the order of the items, use the _Add Item_ link to create a new item, and use the blue arrow to the left of the item name to _Edit_ an existing item.

### Author Guidelines

Use this field to add information for your authors that will be useful during the submission process. This information will be displayed on the journal website.
-  Author Guidelines: Recommended guidelines include required file types for the submission document, the preferred citation format, or any elements that should be present in the submission.

-  Copyright Notice: This is the author copyright agreement between the author and the journal, and the author agrees to these terms at the time of submission.

## Review

This tab allows you to configure your journal's review process.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-review.png)

### Setup

**Default Review Mode**: Select whether your journal will follow a double blind, blind, or open review process.

**Restrict File Access**:Check this off if you want the reviewer to respond to the request before accessing the submission files.

**One-click Reviewer Access**: Enable (default) the first option to provide reviewers with one-click access to the review, bypassing the need to go to the website, login, and find the submission. For security reasons with this option, editors are not able to modify email addresses or add CCs or BCCs prior to sending invitations to reviewers.

**Default Review Deadlines**: Indicate how long reviewers have to decide to accept or decline a review request from the editor, and how long they have to make a recommendation.

**Automated Email Reminders**: Reviewers will automatically be notified when they are assigned to a review; however, you may wish to enable or disable reminder emails for reviewers. Use the drop down menu to select either the number of days or “Never Remind” under “Send a reminder if a reviewer has not responded to a review request within the following time (days) after response due date” to set the number of days that can pass after the due date before reviewers will be reminded to accept or reject a review request.

Use the drop down menu to select either the number of days or “Never Remind” under “Send a reminder if a reviewer has not responded to a review request within the following time (days) after response due date” to set the number of days that can pass after the due date before reviewers will be reminded to make a recommendation for a submission.

Hit the **Save** button to record your changes.

Note that some system settings must be configured by the Site Administrator to send email. See the [Administrator's Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/email) for more information.

### Review Guidance

**Review Guidelines**: Provide your reviewers with criteria for judging a submission's suitability for publication in the press, which may include instructions for preparing an effective and helpful review.

**Competing Interests**: Add your competing interest disclosure policy statement here.

### Review Forms

Review forms provide reviewers with a set of questions to respond to. This can help focus their feedback in ways that is more useful to you.

**Create Review Form**: Use the Create Review Form link to make a new form.

![](./assets/learning-ojs-3-settings-workflow-settings-review-create.png)

The Description and Instructions provide information about the form and when to use it for Journal Managers and Editors. This content is not included on the form that reviewers see. You can add instructions and guidelines for reviewers under Review Guidelines \(below\).

Back at the Review Forms page, select the blue arrow to the left of the form name to reveal the Edit link.

![](./assets/learning-ojs-3-settings-workflow-settings-review-edit1.png)

Select the Edit link and complete the form.

![](./assets/learning-ojs-3-settings-workflow-settings-review-create-items.png)

**Form Items** are form questions.

You can choose whether to make the question mandatory for reviewers and visible to the author.

You can then choose the type of response, including:

* a single word text box
* a single line text box
* an extended text box \(for longer answers\)
* checkboxes \(where the reviewer can select multiple possible responses\)
* radio buttons \(where the reviewer can only select one possible answer\)
* dropdown menu \(also where reviewers can only select one possible answer\)

**Response Options** are the selections you make available for the checkboxes, radio buttons, or dropdown menus. A good example of a checkbox response is a [Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale), where the reviewer must choose only one option: E.g., Good, Neutral, Bad.

Remember to hit the **Save** button to record your changes.

Use the **Preview** tab to test out the form.

![](./assets/learning-ojs-3-settings-workflow-settings-review-preview.png)

Once you send the form to a reviewer you will no longer be able to edit it because that would change the record for existing reviews using that form. If you want to make changes to the review form at that point you can copy the existing form and create a new updated version.

**Blind Review**: Check this box to display a link for instructions on ensuring all submission files are anonymized.

## Publisher Library

The Journal Manager and Editors may upload documents that they would like to share with the other users in the Publisher Library. Any document added in this area will be visible within a user’s Document Library in their manuscript’s Submission Library.

You can also upload a file here that you would like to be publicly accessible via a URL, which you can link to from other parts of your site, including the author guidelines, submission checklist, or a static page.

Suggested forms that can be uploaded in this area can include the galley approval form, supplemental material cover page, and other forms related to your journals workflow.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-publib1.png)

To add a file here, click ‘Add a file’ on the top right corner of the Publisher Library box.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-publib2.png)

**Name**: Title of Document you want to appear to the user

**Type**: Select Marketing, Permission, Reports, Other

**Public Access**: Enabling this will allow users to download this file using the hyperlink provided if it is hyperlinked in other parts of your journal site.

## Emails

### Setup

The section allows you to configure the emails that are sent out from the system.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-emails.png)

**Signature**: The information in this field will be added to the bottom of every email sent out by the system.

**Bounce Address**: A notice will be sent to this email address of any system-sent emails that fail to deliver, such as when the targeted email address is no longer valid.

### Email Templates

OJS facilitates work flow communication through the use of prepared email messages. You can view and modify these prepared email templates here. Please note, some configuration is required to send email. See the [Administrator's Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/email) for more information.

#### Edit email templates

When you edit an email template, you change what it will say every time it is used.  For emails that are sent voluntarily, such as a message sent to a reviewer asking them to review a submission, you can also change the contents of the message at the time of sending it. This changes the contents for that message only.

To edit a template:
1. Go to Workflow Settings > Emails > Prepared Email Templates
2. Click the blue arrow next to the template name to reveal links below it
3. Click Edit
4. Make changes to the subject and the body text. Be careful to not delete any tags such as “{$authorName}:,” which automatically insert content from a submission.
5. When you’re finished editing, click Save.

![](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-email-templates.png)

#### Disable email templates

All of the templates are enabled by default when you install OJS, but you can disable some templates by clicking the Disable button. Most of the templates that can be disabled are messages that are sent automatically by OJS. Disabling the template will mean that the automatic notification will not be sent.

To disable a template:
1. Go to Workflow Settings > Emails > Prepared Email Templates
2. Click the blue arrow next to the template name to reveal links below it
3. Click Disable (if the button does not appear, then this template can't be disabled)

#### Reload default email templates

If you have edited email templates but want to reverse the edits and restore them to their default contents, you can reset them:
1. Go to Workflow Settings > Emails > Prepared Email Templates
2. Click Reset All Templates
3. When the confirmation message appears, click OK.

#### Add email template

Click the button **Add Email Template** to create a custom email template that you can use when notifying a user or adding a participant to a submission. Note that in versions earlier than OJS 3.1.2, you can create a custom email templates but it will not be available to use at any stage in the workflow.

#### Filters

Click here to filter email templates based on the following: Enabled, Disabled, Custom Template. You can also filter email templates based on who it was sent from and who it is sent to.

#### Add email attachment

There is no direct email attachment option in OJS 3, but you can upload and share public files via the Publisher Library:

1. In Settings > Workflow > Publisher Library > Add a file, upload your document and tick the “Public Access” checkbox
2. Click "OK" for the URL to be generated
3. Insert the URL in your email

You can also choose to modify an existing email template with this URL, or share it publicly on the website.

#### Template descriptions

OJS 3.2 now provides a description for every template outlining the sender and recipient, stage of workflow.

The table below provides an overview of the prepared email templates found in OJS 3.2. Note that "Editor" refers to any type of editor (e.g. journal editor, production editor, etc.). The following columns appear in the table:

- **Template**: The name of the email template.
- **Description**: A description of the template.
- **Sender**: The name or signature that will appear at the end of the message. In some cases, the system sends the message automatically but the sender appears as a particular user.
- **Recipient**: Who the email can be sent to.
- **Workflow** stage: The workflow stage that this template is used in.

| Template                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Sender                             | Recipient             | Workflow                 |
