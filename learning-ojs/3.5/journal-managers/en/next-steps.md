# Next Steps: Publishing Content and Extended Functionality
After configuring relevant settings, inviting key users, configuring your content access, customizing the design of your site, and learning how to communicate with users, you are ready to start thinking about getting content in your journal.

In this chapter, you can choose the next step of your journey with OJS. Each section will direct you to the guides and information that you will need to successfully publish your content.
