* [English](en/)
* [Português](pt/)

The Creating Accessible Content guide covers the general principles of creating universally accessible content published on the web. It highlights techniques to address specific limitations for the use of assistive technologies, such as screen readers for people with visual impairment or sign language for those with auditory limitations. Finally, it gives specific tips on creating different galley formats in an accessible way.

This guide will be useful for authors in preparation of their manuscripts and for editors in formatting materials for publication and adding content to journal websites.
