# OJS Upgrade Guide

* [English](./en)

This guide is a general (version non-specific) Open Journal Systems upgrade guide for technical staff. A list of required knowledge and tools is provided. While this guide focuses solely on OJS and the LAMP stack, the information here can be adapted to suit other PKP products (i.e. OMP, OPS) and other stacks with some modifications.
