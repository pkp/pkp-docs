Make a request with the `get` method, and use the `filterParams`, `searchPhrase`, `offset` and `count` properties to modify the request.\\n\\nWhen you update the `searchPhrase` or `filterParams` data properties on the component, it will automatically compile the params and make a GET request to the `apiPath`.\\n\\n**Never modify the `getParams` property.** These params represent the component's default state. Instead, use `filterParams` or `searchPhrase` to dynamically filter the list.\\n\\n### Loading Spinner\\n\\nWhen the list is updating, you should include a loading spinner next to the title of the list. You can display this whenever the `isLoading` flag is true by using the following structure for your list title:\\n\\n```html\\n<div class=\\\"pkpListPanel__title\\\">\\n\\t{{ i18n.title }}\\n\\t<span v-if=\\\"isLoading\\\" class=\\\"pkpSpinner\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"></span>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n\\nThe items list can be updated (eg - searching, filtering, loading more, or adding to the list). When using one of these features, the `.pkpListPanel__items` element must contain the `aria-live=\\\"polite\\\"` attribute. When a list is updated, this will alert the user in an non-intrusive way.\\n\\n## Searching\\n\\nAdd the `ListPanelSearch` component when a user wants to find one or more items by typing in a search phrase. Some examples:\\n\\n- Find a submission by title or author\\n- Find a user by name, surname, email or username\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n\\nThe search input field **must** include a `<label>` that usefully describes the control in the absence of visual icons. A `placeholder` attribute is not sufficient.\\n\\n## Filtering\\n\\nAdd the `ListPanelFilter` component when a user wants to find all items in a group. Some examples:\\n\\n- Find a submission by section, series or category\\n- Find all submissions that are incomplete or on a given stage in the workflow\\n- Find all users of a role\\n\\nWhen using filters, the `ListPanel` component expects to receive a `filters` key with an object containing the filters. Consult the example data for the complete specification.\\n\\nWhen selected filters change, `ListPanelFilter` will fire a `filterList` event and pass all `activeFilters`. A `ListPanel` is expected to respond to this event by updating the `filterParams` and firing the `get()` method to refresh the list. At the moment, filtering is only available on `ListPanel` components with a working `get()` method.\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n\\nWhen `isFilterVisible` is false, filter buttons must have `tabindex=\\\"-1\\\"` to prevent them from receiving focus. Remove this attribute when visible to let them be focused.\\n\\nFilters should always include a `.pkpListPanel__filterHeader` element which describes the filter set. When visible, the element should have `tabindex=\\\"0\\\"` so that it can be focused. When `isFilterVisible` is changed to true, the focus will be shifted to this element.\\n\\n## Ordering\\n\\nThis component will support item ordering by drag-and-drop and via keyboard controls. This feature requires the following:.\\n\\n1. The `ListPanelItem` component has a sub-component of `Orderer` as the first part of the item's template.\\n2. The `ListPanel` component wraps the `ListPanelItem` sub-components in a `draggable` sub-component. (See [Vue.Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable))\\n3. The `isOrdering` data key is set to `true`.\\n4. To persist the changed order to the database, override the `setItemOrderSequence` method to fire off a post request.\\n5. To cancel ordering and reset the order from the current database values, use the `cancelOrdering` method. It will call the `get` method to repopulate the list.\\n6. To toggle ordering on and off, use the `toggleOrdering` method.\\n\\nWhen ordering can be switched on and off, the list panel should hide any unnecessary details during ordering. The user should be able to do nothing else with the `ListPanel` when ordering. Unnecessary sub-components like `ListPanelSearch` and `ListPanelFilter` are hidden whenever the `-isOrdering` class is added to the `ListPanel`. Use this class to hide any other elements which are not useful during sorting, including those within the `ListItem`.\\n\\n### Accessibility\\n\\nWhen ordering items, set `tabindex=\\\"-1\\\"` on any unnecessary elements which could otherwise receive focus. A keyboard user should focus on *only* the up/down buttons.\\n\\nExceptions can be made in cases where contextual information may be important. For example, when ordering catalog entries, the link to the item remains visible.\\n\\nUse the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to navigate the list with your keyboard to test your work.\\n\\n## Expanding and Collapsing\\n\\nA `ListPanelItem` can have a summary and detailed view with a button to open the detailed view. The **With Expander** example shows how to create this effect. It requires a `ListPanelItem` with the following markup:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- Add the .pkpListPanelItem--hasSummary class to the outer wrapper -->\\n<li class=\\\"pkpListPanelItem pkpListPanelItem--hasSummary\\\">\\n\\n\\t<!-- Nest the summary view in a .pkpListPanelItem__summary class -->\\n\\t<div class=\\\"pkpListPanelItem__summary\\\">\\n\\t\\t<div class=\\\"pkpListPanelItem__item\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t{{ item.title }}\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t<!-- Add a .pkpListPanelItem__expander button as the last child of the summary -->\\n\\t\\t<button\\n\\t\\t\\t@click=\\\"toggleExpanded\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\tclass=\\\"pkpListPanelItem__expander\\\"\\n\\t\\t>\\n\\t\\t\\t<icon v-if=\\\"isExpanded\\\" icon=\\\"angle-up\\\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<icon v-else icon=\\\"angle-down\\\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t<span v-if=\\\"isExpanded\\\" class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">View less</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<span v-else class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">View More</span>\\n\\t\\t</button>\\n\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t<!-- Add the details panel in a .pkpListPanelItem__details class -->\\n\\t<div\\n\\t\\tv-if=\\\"isExpanded\\\"\\n\\t\\tclass=\\\"pkpListPanelItem__details\\\"\\n\\t>\\n\\t\\tHere are the expanded details about this item.\\n\\t</div>\\n</li>\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<list>\\n\\t\\t<list-item v-for=\\\"item in items\\\" :key=\\\"item\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t{{ item }}\\n\\t\\t\\t<orderer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t@up=\\\"up\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t@down=\\\"down\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t:itemId=\\\"item\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t:itemTitle=\\\"item\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t:isDraggable=\\\"isDraggable\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t:i18n=\\\"i18n\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t/>\\n\\t\\t</list-item>\\n\\t</list>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport List from '@/components/List/List.vue';\\nimport ListItem from '@/components/List/ListItem.vue';\\nimport Orderer from '@/components/Orderer/Orderer.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tList,\\n\\t\\tListItem,\\n\\t\\tOrderer\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata: function() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\titems: ['One', 'Two', 'Three'],\\n\\t\\t\\tisDraggable: false,\\n\\t\\t\\ti18n: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torderUp: 'Increase position of {$itemTitle}',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torderDown: 'Decrease position of {$itemTitle}'\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t},\\n\\tmethods: {\\n\\t\\t/**\\n\\t\\t * Movin' on up!\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * @param id string|int The item to move\\n\\t\\t */\\n\\t\\tup: function(id) {\\n\\t\\t\\tconst index = this.items.findIndex(item => {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn item === id;\\n\\t\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\t\\tif (!index) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.items.splice(index - 1, 0, this.items.splice(index, 1)[0]);\\n\\t\\t},\\n\\n\\t\\t/**\\n\\t\\t * Get down tonight!\\n\\t\\t *\\n\\t\\t * @param id string|int The item to move\\n\\t\\t */\\n\\t\\tdown: function(id) {\\n\\t\\t\\tconst index = this.items.findIndex(item => {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn item === id;\\n\\t\\t\\t});\\n\\t\\t\\tif (index < 0 || index >= this.items.length - 1) {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn;\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.items.splice(index + 1, 0, this.items.splice(index, 1)[0]);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nUse this component to display content in tabs.\\n\\nFull details about this component can be found in the [vue-tabs-component](https://github.com/spatie/vue-tabs-component).\\n\\n## Nested Tabs\\n\\nWhen nesting tabs, be sure to use the `useUrlFragment` option to prevent the `#tabName` anchor from being added. The URL anchor only works for top-level tabs. Consider the following:\\n\\n```html\\n<tabs>\\n\\t<tab name=\\\"first\\\">\\n\\t\\tFirst tab content\\n\\t</tab>\\n\\t<tab name=\\\"second\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tabs>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab name=\\\"second-a\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTab A Content\\n\\t\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab name=\\\"second-b\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTab B content\\n\\t\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t</tabs>\\n\\t</tab>\\n</tabs>\\n```\\n\\nWhen the `second-b` tab is visited at the URL `https://example.org`, the URL will be `https://example.org#second-b`. If this URL is copied, shared or refreshed, it will not return the visitor to the correct tab. It can only open the correct tab when the anchor points to a top-level tab.\\n\\nUse the following to turn off the anchor for nested tabs.\\n\\n```html\\n<tabs>\\n\\t<tab name=\\\"first\\\">\\n\\t\\tFirst tab content\\n\\t</tab>\\n\\t<tab name=\\\"second\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tabs :options=\\\"{ useUrlFragment: false }\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab name=\\\"second-a\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTab A Content\\n\\t\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab name=\\\"second-b\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTab B content\\n\\t\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t</tabs>\\n\\t</tab>\\n</tabs>\\n```\\n\\n## Deep Nesting\\n\\nAvoid deep nesting. The deeper content is nested, the more work it takes to return to that content when the page is refreshed. Also, it is very difficult to navigate to deeply nested content programmatically.\\n\\nConsider two levels a maximum.

If you contribute you may be asked to document your changes. This document describes how to add and edit documentation for a component.\\n\\n## File Structure\\n\\nAll of the files loaded by OJS or OMP can be found in `/src/components`, `/src/mixins`, and `/src/styles`. Everything else in this repository is only used to run this library.\\n\\n- `/public` Global files that help run the UI Library app. Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/components` The component source files. All imports from OJS and OMP should be here.\\n- `/src/docs` The files used to document and preview components. Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/docs/components` Files for displaying and documenting individual components in the UI Library. Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/docs/pages` Markdown files for description pages that are not specific to a component, such as this page you are reading now.\\n- `/src/mixins` [Mixins](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/mixins.html) used in components. Used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/styles` LESS styles that are imported into global stylesheets and components. Some files used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/App.vue` The main component that runs the UI Library. Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/main.js` Loads dependencies and initializes the UI Library. Not used in OJS and OMP, but often dependencies must be synced with `js/load.js` and `/lib/pkp/js/load.js` in those applications.\\n- `/src/router.js` The router for the UI Library. Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n\\n## Creating a Component Demo\\n\\nEach documented component requires the following:\\n\\n- documented props, data and events,\\n- an example of the component in action\\n- usage guidance\\n\\nThis section will describe the files that are used to document the [HelpButton](#/component/HelpButton) component. You can use this as a guide to documenting your own components.\\n\\nCreate a basic preview of the component:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/previews/PreviewHelpButton.vue -->\\n<template>\\n\\t<help-button\\n\\t\\ttopic=\\\"settings\\\"\\n\\t\\tsection=\\\"workflow-library\\\"\\n\\t\\tlabel=\\\"Learn more about the Publisher Library\\\"\\n\\t/>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport HelpButton from '@/components/HelpButton/HelpButton.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tHelpButton,\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nCreate a `config.js` file that exports default props and describes every prop accepted by the component:\\n\\n```js\\n// /src/docs/components/HelpButton/config.js\\nexport let props = {\\n\\ttopic: 'settings',\\n\\tsection: 'workflow-library',\\n\\tlabel: 'Learn more about the Publisher Library'\\n}\\n\\nexport const propDocs = [\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tkey: 'topic',\\n\\t\\tdescription: 'Which topic to open in the help panel. This will correspond with one of the `.md` files used in the help panel. Do not include the `.md` extension.'\\n\\t},\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tkey: 'section',\\n\\t\\tdescription: 'Open the help panel to a particular section of the topic. This must match one of the named anchors in the topic page, such as `<a name=\\\"workflow-library\\\"></a>`.'\\n\\t},\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tkey: 'label',\\n\\t\\tdescription: 'A localized label for screen readers. In English this should be \\\"Help\\\".'\\n\\t}\\n]\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tprops,\\n\\tpropDocs\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf your component accepts data or emits events, those should be documented and exported as `data`, `dataDocs`, and `events`.\\n\\nCreate an example of the component:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/ExampleHelpButton.vue -->\\n<script>\\nimport Example from '@/docs/Example.vue';\\nimport PreviewHelpButton from './previews/PreviewHelpButton.vue';\\n// !raw-loader helps us extract the pre-compiled template from the preview\\nimport fileContent from '!raw-loader!./previews/PreviewHelpButton.vue';\\nimport config from './config';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Example,\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tPreviewHelpButton\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\t...config,\\n\\t\\t\\tcomponent: 'preview-help-button',\\n\\t\\t\\tprops: config.props,\\n\\t\\t\\ttemplate: this.extractTemplate(fileContent),\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nNotice how the `config` object is passed to the data. This is used to provide consistent starting props, data, and documentation for all examples of a component.\\n\\nCreate the parent documentation component and pass each example:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/ComponentHelpButton.vue -->\\n<script>\\nimport Component from '@/docs/Component.vue';\\nimport ExampleHelpButton from './ExampleHelpButton.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Component,\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tExampleHelpButton,\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tname: 'Help Button',\\n\\t\\t\\texamples: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ExampleHelpButton': 'Base'\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nTo create multiple examples for a component, import additional `Example*` components and add them to the `examples` data object.\\n\\nCreate a `readme.md` file to provide usage guidance for the component:\\n\\n```md\\n<!--- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/readme.md --->\\nUse this component to display an icon that will open the help panel when clicked.\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAdd a route to `/src/router.js`:\\n\\n```js\\n...\\nimport ComponentHelpButton from \\\"./docs/components/HelpButton/ComponentHelpButton.vue\\\";\\n\\n...\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tpath: \\\"/component/HelpButton/:example?\\\",\\n\\t\\tname: \\\"HelpButton\\\",\\n\\t\\tcomponent: ComponentHelpButton,\\n\\t},\\n...\\n```\\n\\nFinally, add a link to the library's list of documented components:\\n\\n```html\\n...\\n\\t<li><router-link to=\\\"/component/HelpButton\\\">HelpButton</router-link></li>\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Linked Components\\n\\nSome components can only be used with a specific parent component. For example, `ListPanelLoadMore` is only used in `ListPanel` components.\\n\\nWhen documenting such components, add an example that demonstrates this relationship and label it \\\"With <name-of-child-component>\\\".\\n\\nSee [ListPanel/ListPanelLoadMore](http://localhost:8080/component/ListPanel/ListPanelLoadMore).\\n\\n## ESLint and Prettier\\n\\nThis library runs ESLint and Prettier to maintain code formatting. When you are running `npm run serve`, any file changes will be linted and errors will be reported in the console.\\n\\nWhen you commit, ESLint and Prettier will run. You will not be able to commit if there are ESLint errors.\\n\\n## Issues\\n\\nIssues for for this library should be opened on the [pkp/pkp-lib](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/) repository. All issues related to OJS and OMP are managed there, including issues with this UI Library.\\n\\n## Pull Requests\\n\\nPull Requests for this library should be opened on the [pkp/ui-library](https://github.com/pkp/ui-library/pulls) repository.\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ListItem.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\";

Component-specific guidelines are outlined within each component's Notes section. The following are broad accessibility guidelines which should be followed.\\n\\n## Focus state and keyboard-based navigation\\n\\nAlways test by navigating components with a keyboard, using <kbd>TAB</kbd> to cycle through elements. Any HTML elements which are not visible should not receive focus. You should be able to see where the focus is on the page at any time.\\n\\nFor example, a [ListPanelFilter](#/component/detail/list-panel--with-filter) is hidden until enabled. When hidden, focusable elements such as the filter buttons should be skipped when navigating with the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key.\\n\\nFurthermore, all actions should be possible without a mouse. If drag-and-drop features are used, there should be alternative tools for moving items around when only using a keyboard.\\n\\n### Moving focus\\n\\nAs a general rule, you should *never* move the focus programmatically. This can be disorienting and frustrating for users who rely on keyboard navigation.\\n\\nWe make an exception for this when the user performs an action which indicates a particular focus is desired.\\n\\nFor example, when a button is pressed to open a modal, the focus should be moved into that modal and kept there until the modal is closed. When closed, the focus should be returned to the element which opened the modal.\\n\\n### Avoid tabindex\\n\\nAvoid using `tabindex=\\\"1\\\"` and `tabindex=\\\"2\\\"` to enforce the order of navigation. There are only two occassions when you should use `tabindex`:\\n\\n1. Use `tabindex=\\\"-1\\\"` to prevent an item from receiving focus. You may wish to do this to remove drag-and-drop controls from a keyboard user's tab order, or to prevent the user from having to tab through elements which are currently hidden.\\n2. Use `tabindex=\\\"0\\\"` to allow an item to receive focus when it otherwise would not, such as a `<div>` or `<span>` element. This is useful when you want to move the focus to an element, and want to target a heading or label. (Generally, moving the focus should be avoided. See above.)\\n\\n## Labelling for assistive technology\\n\\nWhen a component uses icons or a visual layout to indicate the meaning of something, you must provide a text label for users without sight. You can use the `-screenReader` class to hide the label from sighted users but still expose it to screen readers.\\n\\nYou should _not_ use `display: hidden`, because screen readers will ignore the text.\\n\\n### Hidden search label\\nA search field often uses an icon to indicate it's purpose. The `placeholder` attribute can not be read by all screen readers, so a label is provided and then hidden from sighted users.\\n\\n<div class=\\\"inlinePreview inlinePreview--accessibleSearch\\\">\\n\\t<span class=\\\"fa fa-search\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"></span>\\n\\t<input id=\\\"searchInput\\\" placeholder=\\\"Search submissions\\\">\\n\\t<label for=\\\"searchInput\\\" class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">\\n\\t\\tSearch submissions\\n\\t</label>\\n</div>\\n\\n```html\\n<icon icon=\\\"search\\\" />\\n<input id=\\\"searchInput\\\" placeholder=\\\"Search submissions\\\">\\n<label for=\\\"searchInput\\\" class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">\\n\\tSearch submissions\\n</label>\\n```\\n\\n### Icon-only buttons\\nIn a few cases, an icon may not need a text label for sighted users to understand it's purpose. A hidden text label that indicates the action and which item the action relates to must be provided for those using screen readers.\\n\\n<div class=\\\"inlinePreview inlinePreview--accessibleButton\\\">\\n\\t<div>\\n\\t\\tMy example submission\\n\\t\\t<button>\\n\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"fa fa-times\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"></span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">Delete My example submission</span>\\n\\t\\t</button>\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n```html\\n<li>\\n\\tMy example submission\\n\\t<button @click=\\\"deleteSubmission\\\">\\n\\t\\t<icon icon=\\\"times\\\" />\\n\\t\\t<span class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">Delete My example submission</span>\\n\\t</button>\\n</li>\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nUse this component to display a form. The parent component should respond to the following events:\\n\\n```html\\n<pkp-form\\n\\tv-bind=\\\"formData\\\"\\n\\t@set-fields=\\\"setFormFields\\\"\\n\\t@set-errors=\\\"setFormErrors\\\"\\n\\t@set-visible-locales=\\\"setFormVisibleLocales\\\"\\n/>\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, `formData` will typically be an object compiled from one of the `FormComponent` classes on the server-side.\\n\\n## Multi-page Forms\\n\\nUse a multi-page form when you want to guide the user through a multi-step process that ends in a single action. Reviewer assignment is an example of a multi-step process:\\n\\n1. Select a reviewer\\n2. Select a review type and enter a deadline\\n3. Prepare the notification email\\n\\nWe want to divide the action into smaller steps so that we don't overwhelm the user, but we shouldn't take any action until all steps are complete.\\n\\nDo _not_ use a multi-page form for all related forms, such as those on the settings page. A user may wish to only edit one setting and that change can be saved immediately without depending on further action in related forms.\\n\\nIf you want to indicate that forms are related, without requiring them to be submitted together, use [tabs](#/component/Tab).\\n\\n## Form Submission and Error Handling\\n\\nA `Form` expects to receive a URL to which it can submit a `PUT` or `POST` request to the application's API. Forms can handle the following responses from the API automatically:\\n\\n- A `200` response when successful with a JSON object describing the entity that was added or edited.\\n- A `403` or `404` response when the server refuses the submission with a JSON object describing the error.\\n- A `400` response when a validation error occurs with one of the fields. In this case, a JSON object will be returned with each invalid field as a key and an array of errors for that field.\\n\\nSee the [API Documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api/ojs/dev) for the specification of errors.\\n\\n## Groups and Group Descriptions\\n\\nFields can be organized into groups and given a group title and description. This should be done when fields benefit from the breakdown and when sufficient horizontal space is available.\\n\\nIf a form does not occupy the full workspace (~992px) because it is embedded in a tab or modal, avoid group titles and descriptions to ensure adequate space remains for the form fields.\\n\\n## Conditional Display\\n\\nFields can be shown or hidden based on the value of another field. The `showWhen` prop is used to control conditional display. This prop is documented in the [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase) example.\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nThis component is a special field for the [PKP Preservation Network](https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/) settings.

If you're not familiar with Vue, read its [usage guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) before continuing.\\n\\n## Working with OJS and OMP\\n\\nOJS and OMP load this library as a submodule under `/lib/ui-library/`. In `/js/load.js`, each application loads the components it needs from the UI Library.\\n\\nWhen you are using OJS or OMP from a distributed release package, you will only have a pre-compiled `/js/build.js` file. You will not have the full component library under `/lib/ui-library/`.\\n\\nIf you want to make changes to the components, you will need to use the development repository for [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs) or [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp). Follow the steps described there to setup and install the application.\\n\\n## Compiling for OJS and OMP\\n\\nTo compile the `/js/build.js` file while you are working on the library, run the following command from OJS or OMP's root directory.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run serve\\n```\\n\\nWhen you are done, run the following command to compile an optimized `/js/build.js` for production.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run build\\n```\\n\\n## Display Apps\\n\\nAn \\\"App\\\" is a Vue component that manages `data` and passes `props` to child components. Wherever you want to use a component in OJS or OMP, it must be wrapped inside of an App.\\n\\nRead about [parent components, data, props and events in Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Organizing-Components).\\n\\nYou can place an App into any template in OJS or OMP.\\n\\n```html\\n{assign var=\\\"uuid\\\" value=\\\"\\\"|uniqid|escape}\\n<div id=\\\"my-submission-list-handler-{$uuid}\\\">\\n\\t<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\n\\t\\tpkp.registry.init('my-submission-list-handler-{$uuid}', 'SubmissionsListPanel', {$myQueueListData|json_encode});\\n\\t</script>\\n</div>\\n```\\n\\nThis creates a `SubmissionsListPanel` app. Initial data is passed to the component through `$myQueueListData`, a JSON object which is merged with the component's `data` property.\\n\\nThis is exactly the same as mounting a Vue app to the DOM as recommended in Vue's documentation.\\n\\n```js\\nvar app = new Vue({\\n\\t...SubmissionsListPanel,\\n\\tel: '#my-submission-list-handler-<uuid>',\\n\\tdata: myQueueListDataInJsonFormat\\n})\\n```\\n\\nWe use `pkp.registry.init` to make sure that Vue components mounted inside of our legacy JavaScript toolkit do not cause memory leaks.\\n\\n## Passing events between Apps\\n\\nWhen two Apps need to communicate with each other, you can use the global event bus. The event bus is an instance of Vue so you can use the same [events API](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Instance-Methods-Events) as any other component.\\n\\nSend a global event.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('submissionUpdated', submission);\\n```\\n\\nRespond to a global event.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$on('submissionUpdated', function (submission) {\\n\\t\\tthis.submission = submission;\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Translations\\n\\nThis library uses a common prop, `i18n`, to pass translation strings from component to component. Usually the `i18n` prop is passed in from the server side when the App component is created.\\n\\nWhen the `i18n` prop is available in any component, you can access it normally.\\n\\n```js\\nvar label = this.i18n.label\\n```\\n\\nIf you need to merge values dynamically with a translated string, you can use the `__()` helper method.\\n\\n```js\\n// this.i18n.label = 'Decline {$submissionTitle}'\\nvar label = this.__('label', {submissionTitle: this.title});\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use this method in component templates.\\n\\n```html\\n<button>\\n\\t{{ __('label', {submissionTitle: title}) }}\\n</button>>\\n```\\n\\nNotice that `this` is dropped when invoking the method and properties in templates.\\n\\n## Multiple Languages\\n\\nAll PKP applications are multilingual. Multilingual fields in objects are provided as a JSON object with keys specifying the locale codes. The following response shows the title property of a submission in English and Canadian French.\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n\\t\\\"title\\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\\"en_US\\\": \\\"Young people from an immigrant background and their choice of post-secondary orientation in Montreal\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"fr_CA\\\": \\\"Jeunes issus de l’immigration et choix d’orientation au postsecondaire à Montréal\\\"\\n\\t},\\n\\t...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll components include a helper method, `localize()`, which helps you retrieve a value in the correct language.\\n\\n```js\\nvar title = this.localize(this.title);\\n```\\n\\nThis will return the value in the user's current language or the primary language of the site. If it doesn't exist in either of these locales, it will return the first locale it finds.\\n\\nYou can also request a specific locale.\\n\\n```js\\nvar title = this.localize(this.title, 'fr_CA');\\n```\\n\\n## CSRF Token\\n\\nAny component which sends a `PUT`, `POST` or `DELETE` request to an OJS or OMP API endpoint _must_ include a [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) in the header.\\n\\nYou will need to generate the CSRF token on the server and pass it to your component. You can then add this to the header of a jQuery ajax request.\\n\\n```js\\n$.ajax({\\n\\theaders: {\\n\\t\\t'X-Csrf-Token': this.csrfToken,\\n\\t},\\n\\t...\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Global Vue Instance\\n\\nYou may want to modify the global Vue object. This may be necessary if you:\\n\\n- Add custom components\\n- Use third-party plugins\\n- Add global mixins\\n\\nYou can access the global Vue object at `pkp.Vue`.\\n\\nIf a Vue plugin tells you it should be registered with `Vue.use(...)`, you can use `pkp.Vue.use(...)`.\\n\\n*Your intervention will likely happen before Apps are instantiated and mounted, but after the global event bus is instantiated.*\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<li class=\\\"pkpListPanelItem\\\" :class=\\\"{'-isOrdering':
