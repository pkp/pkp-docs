In most cases, the URL should correspond to your application's [API endpoint for temporary files](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api).\\n\\nIf you do not use this endpoint, your endpoint should respond to `OPTIONS` and `POST` requests that [Dropzone.js](https://www.dropzonejs.com) makes to upload the file. The response should match that documented in the [API endpoint for temporary files](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api).\"","export * from \"-!../../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./PreviewPage.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<list>\\n\\t\\t<list-item>\\n\\t\\t\\t<template slot=\\\"value\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<icon icon=\\\"comment-o\\\" :inline=\\\"true\\\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t32\\n\\t\\t\\t</template>\\n\\t\\t\\tNumber of active discussions in this journal.\\n\\t\\t</list-item>\\n\\t\\t<list-item>\\n\\t\\t\\t<template slot=\\\"value\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<icon icon=\\\"clock-o\\\" :inline=\\\"true\\\" />\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t67\\n\\t\\t\\t</template>\\n\\t\\t\\tDays until next issue is published.\\n\\t\\t</list-item>\\n\\t\\t<list-item>\\n\\t\\t\\t<icon icon=\\\"exclamation-triangle\\\" :inline=\\\"true\\\" />\\n\\t\\t\\tThis journal is not currently available for the public to view.

Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `defaultTab` | Select one of the tabs by default. Pass the tab's `id` prop. |\\n| `isSideTabs` | Displays the tabs on the side with content on the right when `true`. |\\n| `label` | Sets an `aria-label` for the tabs. See the [Accessible label](#accessible-label) section below. |\\n| `badge` | Adds a [Badge](#/component/Badge) component beside the icon or text in the tab. |\\n| `trackHistory` | When `true`, changes to the current tab will modify the browser history so that the back button can be used. |\\n\\n## Events\\n\\nThis component does not emit any events.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nUse this component to display content in tabs.\\n\\n## Accessible label\\n\\nPass a `label` to the `Tabs` component to improve the experience for assistive technology. For example, a group of settings tabs might be labeled like this:\\n\\n```html\\n<tabs label=\\\"Website Settings Sections\\\">\\n\\t<tab>...</tab>\\n\\t<tab>...</tab>\\n</tabs>\\n```\\n\\nA `label` is not needed when the tabs immediately follow a heading which describes the tabs. Otherwise a `label` should be used.\\n\\n## Open tab programmatically\\n\\nTabs listen for an `open-tab` event on the global event bus. To open a tab, fire this event and pass the tab `id`:\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('open-tab', 'publication')\\n```\\n\\nThis only works when the tab is visible. If the `publication` tab was nested inside of other tabs and was not visible, it would not be displayed. Consider the following code:\\n\\n```html\\n<tabs>\\n\\t<tab id=\\\"hello\\\" label=\\\"Hello\\\">...</tab>\\n\\t<tab id=\\\"world\\\" label=\\\"World\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tabs>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab id=\\\"lorem\\\" label=\\\"Lorem\\\">...</tab>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab id=\\\"ipsum\\\" label=\\\"Ipsum\\\">...</tab>\\n\\t\\t</tabs>\\n\\t</tab>\\n</tabs>\\n```\\n\\nIf the `hello` tab is currently visible, firing `pkp.eventBus.$emit('open-tab', 'ipsum')` will not work, because its tab set is not currently visible.\\n\\n## Icon-only Tab Buttons\\n\\nAvoid using icon-only tabs except in rare cases. A text label is almost always easier to understand.\\n\\nYou must still pass a `label` to a `Tab` when using the `icon` property. It will be read out by assistive technology.\\n\\n## Deep Nesting\\n\\nAvoid deeply nesting tabs. The deeper content is nested in tabs, the more work it takes to return to that content when the page is refreshed. Also, it is very difficult to navigate to deeply nested content programmatically.\\n\\nConsider two levels a maximum. If you want to use more than two levels of tabs, discuss this with colleagues before proceeding.\\n\"","module.exports = \"## Usage\\n\\nNotify the user when something changes by emitting a `notify` event on the global event bus.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('notify', 'The DOI for this submission has been scheduled for deposit.');\\n```\\n\\nUse the `success` status to indicate an action has finished successfully.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('notify', 'The submission has been published.', 'success');\\n```\\n\\nUse the `warning` status to indicate an action that has failed or which may need to be corrected by the user.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('notify', 'An ORCID is required for all authors.', 'error');\\n```\\n\\nThe notifications will disappear after a few seconds, unless the user is hovering their mouse over the notification. Pass the `clear-all-notify` event if you need to clear all the events off the screen immediately.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('clear-all-notify');\\n```\\n\\nA [Page](#/component/Page) must be present in order to receive the event and display the notification. This should be available on every page in the editorial backend.\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\nThese notifications should not contain actions such as buttons or links. The notification will be read out by a screen reader, but some users will not be able to navigate to the notification to perform an action before it disappears.\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<field-options v-bind=\\\"field\\\" @change=\\\"change\\\" />\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport FieldOptions from '@/components/Form/fields/FieldOptions.vue';\\nimport PreviewFieldBase from '../../FieldBase/previews/PreviewFieldBase.vue';\\nimport fieldBase from '../../../helpers/field-base';\\nimport field from '../../../helpers/field-options-confirmation';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: PreviewFieldBase,\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tFieldOptions\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tfield: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t...fieldBase,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t...field\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FieldRadioInput.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"## Props\\n\\n| Key | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `topic` | Which topic to open in the help panel.

You must write the template in Smarty on the server-side and it will be compiled at run time.\\n\\nThe examples here provide sample templates for two use-cases.\\n\"","module.exports = \"## Props\\n\\n| Key | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `name` | The key for this field. Used in the `name` attribute of `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>` and other fields. The form will submit the value for this field under this name, so it must match an accepted value of the API endpoint. |\\n| `component` | Used internally to load the appropriate component. For example, to load the `FieldText` component this should be `field-text`. |\\n| `label` | The `<label>` for this field. May be used in a `<fieldset>` when appropriate. All form fields should have an accessible label. |\\n| `description` | Adds a description to the field. Can include HTML code. |\\n| `tooltip` | Adds a tooltip to the field. Can include HTML code. |\\n| `helpTopic` | Adds a button to the field which will open the in-app help panel to this topic. |\\n| `helpSection` | When the in-app help panel is opened to `helpTopic`, it will scroll to `helpSection` if included. |\\n| `groupId` | The ID of the group this field should appear in. |\\n| `formId` | The ID of the form this field should appear in. This is passed down from the `Form`. |\\n| `isRequired` | Whether or not a value for this field should be required. |\\n| `isMultilingual` | Whether or not this field should be presented for each supported language. |\\n| `localeKey` | If the field `isMultilingual`, this will be set to the locale key of this particular instance. This is passed down from the `Form`. |\\n| `primaryLocale` | The primary locale for this form. This is passed down from the `Form`. |\\n| `locales` | The locales supported by this form. This is passed down from the `Form`. |\\n| `showWhen` | The `name` of another field which should have a truthy value before this field is shown. You can also pass an array to require a specific value. For example, `['primaryLocale', 'en_US']` would hide this field unless the `primaryLocale` field had a value of `en_US`. |\\n| `value` | The current value. |\\n| `allErrors` | An object containing all errors in the form. This is passed down from the `Form`. |\\n\\n## Events\\n\\n| Key | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `change` | Emitted when the value of the field changes. Payload: `(name, property, value, [localeKey])`. The `localeKey` will be null for fields that are not multilingual. This event is fired every time the value changes, so you should [debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debounce) event callbacks that contain resource-intensive code.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThis is a base component for all `Field*` components. The props described above are available for all `Field*` components.\\n\\nThis component should *not* be used directly. It is presented for demonstration purposes only.

This can be useful when you want disparate parts of the application to react to a common change.\\n\\nFor example, when a submission is deleted you may need to remove it from more than one list of submissions and remove any tasks related to it.\\n\\nUse the following to emit a global event.\\n\\n```json\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('updated:email-template', {...});\\n```\\n\\nUse the following to react to a global event.\\n\\n```js\\n// Update an email template in a list when it changes\\npkp.eventBus.$on('updated:email-template', (emailTemplate) => {\\n\\tthis.templates = this.templates.map(template => {\\n\\t\\treturn template.key === emailTemplate.key\\n\\t\\t\\t? emailTemplate\\n\\t\\t\\t: template;\\n\\t});\\n});\\n```\\n\\nGlobal event names should use kebab-case (`example-name`).

Any props you pass will be merged with defaults and can override them. See [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/). |\\n| `plugins` | Specify plugins the TinyMCE editor should load. See [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/#plugins). |\\n| `preparedContent` | An optional object containing preset information. When preset information exists, a button will appear in the toolbar. See the [Prepared Content](#/component/Form/fields/FieldRichTextarea/ExamplePreparedContent) example. |\\n| `renderPreparedContent` | When `true` prepared content will be rendered into the template. When `false`, a placeholder will be added. Default is `false`. See the guidance below. |\\n| `size` | One of `default` or `large`. Default: `default`. |\\n| `toolbar` | Provide the TinyMCE editor with a custom toolbar. See [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tinymce.com/docs/configure/editor-appearance/#toolbar). |\\n| `uploadUrl` | Optionally provide a URL where images and other files can be uploaded. You still need to add the appropriate buttons and plugins to the `toolbar` and `plugins` props. The most common use is the [image](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/plugins/image/) plugin. |\\n| `wordLimit` | Optionally provide a word limit and the editor will display the word count as they type. |\\n\\n## Events\\n\\nSee [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase).\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nUse this component to provide the user with a rich text input area that supports bold, italics, links and other HTML code.\\n\\nThis component uses the TinyMCE editor. You can pass `toolbar`, `plugins` and `init` props to customize the editor. See the [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/).\\n\\nThe `size` of the input area will signal to the user how much information they should enter into the field.\\n\\nThe default `size` is best for one to two large paragraphs. If you expect a user to enter more than that, consider using the large size when it fits appropriately within the the form where it appears.\\n\\n## Image Uploads\\n\\nThe editor will support image uploads, which are placed in the user's directory in the `public` files directory. You must provide the URL to the public files API and add the plugin and toolbar button.\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tuploadUrl: 'http://journal.com/api/v1/_uploadPublicFile',\\n\\ttoolbar: 'bold italic | link | image',\\n\\tplugins: 'paste,link,image'\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe image upload will _not_ work in this documented example. It requires a valid upload URL. Use the following to get the `uploadUrl` from within a PKP application:\\n\\n```php\\n$dispatcher = Application::get()\\n\\t->getRequest()\\n\\t->getDispatcher();\\n\\n$uploadUrl = $dispatcher->url(\\n\\tApplication::get()->getRequest(),\\n\\tROUTE_API,\\n\\t$context->getPath(),\\n\\t'_uploadPublicFile'\\n);\\n```\\n\\nUsers must be logged in to upload files.\\n\\n## Prepared Content\\n\\nThe `preparedContent` prop allows you to pass content to the editor and give the user a point-and-click tool to add that content. This is intended to be used in cases where data can be rendered inside of an email template.\\n\\nWhen an editor is assigning a reviewer, the reviewer's name and the due date can be passed to the editor so that the editor can inject this information directly into the email.\\n\\nIn such cases, the `renderPreparedContent` prop should be set to `true`. This will render the reviewer's name and due date directly into the content as the editor is writing the email.\\n\\nHowever, when editing email templates, we must preserve the placeholders. In such cases, the `renderPreparedContent` prop should be set to `false`. Instead of adding the reviewer's name, a placeholder will be inserted that says `[Reviewer Name]`.\\n\\nThe [Prepared Content](#/component/Form/fields/FieldRichTextarea/ExamplePreparedContent) example shows the placeholders that are used when `renderPreparedContent` is `false`.\\n\"","export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./WorkflowPage.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"## Props\\n\\nThis is a root component.

When the request is finished the item will be removed from view.\\n\\nIn this case, the item should exist within an element that includes the `aria-live` attribute (such as a list).\\n\\nIf the deleted item is not within an element that includes the `aria-live` attribute, the deletion should be reported in some part of the UI that includes an `aria-live` attribute to ensure that the request success is accessible to a screen reader.\\n\\n### Loading something\\n\\nA `Spinner` may be used when some part of the UI is being loaded for the first time. When the request is finished, an \\\"empty\\\" area of the UI will be filled with content.\\n\\nIn this case, the spinner should be accompanied by text which describes what is loading, such as \\\"Loading submissions\\\".\\n\\nThe parent element should be have an `aria-live` attribute to ensure that the updates are reported to a screen reader when the request is finished.\"","module.exports = \"## Usage\\n\\nThis library uses the [vue-js-modal](https://github.com/euvl/vue-js-modal) component to control modals and dialogs.

Examples might include:\\n\\n- the number of reviews a reviewer is currently undertaking\\n- the number of submissions an editor has been assigned\\n- the number of notifications a user has\\n\\n### Things to avoid\\n\\n**Avoid using too many badges.** Badges should be used to bring attention to key information. If there are too many of them, it will cancel the effect.\\n\\n**Avoid using badges for multiple things in the same space.** A badge works best when it visually links similar attributes of different objects together. Using badges for different kinds of attributes in the same space can make it difficult to determine what each value represents.\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\nA badge often relies on its visual proximity to indicate the meaning: a stage badge may appear beside a submission, a count of reviews beside a reviewer. When adding a badge, always include a `label` for those using a screen reader which fully describes it's meaning without requiring the information presented beside it.\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- Example: a badge representing the submission's stage -->\\n<badge label=\\\"Currently in the review stage\\\">\\n\\t{{ stage }}\\n</badge>\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<multilingual-progress

For example, filtering submissions by those in the Review stage will use the `stageIds` parameter for the REST API endpoint.\\n\\nMore than one `Filter` may share the same `param`, but not the same `value`. For example, filtering by the Review and Copyediting stages will use two filters.\\n\\n```html\\n<pkp-filter\\n\\tlabel=\\\"Review\\\"\\n\\tparam=\\\"stageIds\\\"\\n\\tvalue=\\\"2\\\"\\n\\t...\\n/>\\n<pkp-filter\\n\\tlabel=\\\"Copyediting\\\"\\n\\tparam=\\\"stageIds\\\"\\n\\tvalue=\\\"3\\\"\\n\\t...\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n## Managing Active Filters\\n\\nA parent component must manage which filters are active. By convention, this should be in an `activeFilters` object. See the [ListPanel](#/component/ListPanel) for an example.\\n\\nMost filters should be able to be combined with other filters, so there may be more than one filter active at a time. The following shows what the `activeFilters` object might look like when stage and section filters are applied at the same time:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n\\tstageIds: [2, 3],\\n\\tsectionIds: [1]\\n}\\n```\\n\"","export * from

--- |\\n| `count` | The number of completed multilingual items. |\\n| `total` | The total number of multilingual items available to be completed. |\\n\\n## Events\\n\\nThis component does not emit any events.\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nUse this component to indicate progress towards completing items that are required in multiple languages.\\n\\n## Recommendations\\n\\nThis is primarily intended for use with multilingual input fields, but can be used in other scenarios where we want to indicate to the user that a particular action should be completed in more than one locale.\\n\"","module.exports = \"# Accessibility\\n\\nSome components require specific markup or special handling based on state to ensure that they are accessible. Component-specific guidelines are outlined within each component's Notes section. The following are broad accessibility guidelines which should be followed.\\n\\n## Focus state and keyboard-based navigation\\n\\nIt should be possible to use a component without a mouse. To test this, use the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key to interact with the component and check the following:\\n\\n- Can I use the component? For example, if the component allows reordering items, can I do this with a keyboard?\\n- Can I see where the focus is and is it easy to determine where it moves each time I hit the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key? The focus should never \\\"disappear\\\".\\n\\n### Moving focus\\n\\nAs a general rule, you should *never* move the focus programmatically. This can be disorienting and frustrating for users who rely on keyboard navigation.\\n\\nWe make an exception for this when the user performs an action which indicates a particular focus is desired.\\n\\nFor example, when a button is pressed to open a modal, the focus should be moved into that modal and kept there until the modal is closed. When closed, the focus should be returned to the element which opened the modal.\\n\\n### Avoid tabindex\\n\\nAvoid using the `tabindex` attribute. An exception can be made when you need to use `tabindex=\\\"-1\\\"` to prevent an item from receiving focus. You may wish to do this to remove drag-and-drop controls from a keyboard user's tab order, or to prevent the user from having to tab through elements which are currently hidden.\\n\\n## Labelling for assistive technology\\n\\nWhen a component uses icons or a visual layout to indicate the meaning of something, you must provide a text label for users without sight. You can use the `-screenReader` class to hide the label from sighted users but still expose it to screen readers.\\n\\nYou should _not_ use `display: hidden`, because screen readers will ignore the text.\\n\\n### Hidden search label\\nA search field often uses an icon to indicate it's purpose.

The save button will be disable if this is false. Default: `true`. |\\n| `errors` | Key/value object of messages. The key is the field `name` and the value is an array of errors. Errors are generated during form submission and handled automatically, so this prop can be omitted in most cicumstances. |\\n| `fields` | Array of form fields. This prop is typically configured on the server, using the `Form` and `Field` classes in the PHP application. |\\n| `groups` | Array of form groups. See \\\"Groups and Group Descriptions\\\" below. |\\n| `id` | Used by a parent component, such as `Container`, to identify events emitted from the form and update the form props when necessary. |\\n| `method` | The method to use when submitting the form. This should match the API endpoint that will handle the form. It can be `POST` (create) or `PUT` (edit). |\\n| `pages` | Array of form pages.

Reviewer assignment is an example of a multi-step process:\\n\\n1. Select a reviewer\\n2. Select a review type and enter a deadline\\n3. Prepare the notification email\\n\\nWe want to divide the action into smaller steps so that we don't overwhelm the user, but we shouldn't take any action until all steps are complete.\\n\\nDo _not_ use a multi-page form for all related forms, such as those on the settings page. A user may wish to only edit one setting and that change can be saved immediately without depending on further action in related forms.\\n\\nIf you want to indicate that forms are related, without requiring them to be submitted together, use [tabs](#/component/Tab).\\n\\n## Form Submission and Error Handling\\n\\nA `Form` expects to receive a URL to which it can submit a `PUT` or `POST` request to the application's API. Forms can handle the following responses from the API automatically:\\n\\n- A `200` response when successful with a JSON object describing the entity that was added or edited.\\n- A `403` or `404` response when the server refuses the submission with a JSON object describing the error.\\n- A `400` response when a validation error occurs with one of the fields. In this case, a JSON object will be returned with each invalid field as a key and an array of errors for that field.\\n\\nSee the [API Documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api) for the specification of errors.\\n\\n## Groups and Group Descriptions\\n\\nFields can be organized into groups and given a group title and description. This should be done when fields benefit from the breakdown and when sufficient horizontal space is available.\\n\\nIf a form does not occupy the full workspace (~992px) because it is embedded in a tab or modal, avoid group titles and descriptions to ensure adequate space remains for the form fields.\\n\\n## Conditional Display\\n\\nFields can be shown or hidden based on the value of another field. The `showWhen` prop is used to control conditional display. This prop is documented in the [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase) example.\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"previewPagination\\\">\\n\\t\\t<pagination\\n\\t\\t\\t:current-page=\\\"currentPage\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t:last-page=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t:isLoading=\\\"isLoading\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t@set-page=\\\"setPage\\\"\\n\\t\\t/>\\n\\t\\t<pagination\\n\\t\\t\\t:current-page=\\\"currentPage\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t:last-page=\\\"10\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t:show-adjacent-pages=\\\"2\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t:isLoading=\\\"isLoading\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t@set-page=\\\"setPage\\\"\\n\\t\\t/>\\n\\t</div>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Pagination from '@/components/Pagination/Pagination.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tPagination\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tcurrentPage: 1,\\n\\t\\t\\tisLoading: false\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t},\\n\\tmethods: {\\n\\t\\t/**\\n\\t\\t * Mock a server request delay when changing pages\\n\\t\\t */\\n\\t\\tsetPage(page) {\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.isLoading = true;\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.currentPage = page;\\n\\t\\t\\tsetTimeout(() => {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis.isLoading = false;\\n\\t\\t\\t}, 1000);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\\n<style lang=\\\"less\\\">\\n.previewPagination > * + * {\\n\\tmargin-top: 2rem;\\n}\\n</style>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<tabs\\n\\t\\tdefaultTab=\\\"second\\\"\\n\\t\\tlabel=\\\"Demonstration of tabs with the middle tab opened by default\\\"\\n\\t>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"First tab\\\" id=\\\"first\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tFirst tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Default tab\\\" id=\\\"second\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tDefault tab content displays first when opened\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Third tab\\\" id=\\\"third\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThird tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t</tabs>\\n</template>\\n\"","export * from \"-!../../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./PreviewHeader.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<tabs label=\\\"Demonstration of tabs with icon-only display\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tab icon=\\\"bell-o\\\" label=\\\"First tab\\\" id=\\\"first\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tFirst tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Second tab\\\" id=\\\"second\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tSecond tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Third tab\\\" id=\\\"third\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThird tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t</tabs>\\n</template>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<!-- Use the v-bind syntax to bind all props at once. -->\\n\\t<pkp-form v-bind=\\\"components.example\\\" @set=\\\"set\\\" />\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Container from '@/components/Container/Container.vue';\\nimport form from '../helpers/form-conditional-display';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Container,\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample: form\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<field-upload v-bind=\\\"field\\\" @change=\\\"change\\\" />\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport FieldUpload from '@/components/Form/fields/FieldUpload.vue';\\nimport PreviewFieldBase from '../../FieldBase/previews/PreviewFieldBase.vue';\\nimport fieldBase from '../../../helpers/field-base';\\nimport field from '../../../helpers/field-upload-css';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: PreviewFieldBase,\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tFieldUpload\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tfield: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t...fieldBase,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t...field,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuploadFileLabel: 'Add File',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestoreLabel: 'Restore'\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FieldBaseAutosuggest.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"## Props\\n\\n| Key | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| `...` | Supports all props in [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase) except `value`. |\\n\\n## Events\\n\\nSee [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase).\\n\\n## Usage\\n\\nThis component allows you to insert a block of HTML code between fields in a form.

If you're not familiar with Vue.js, read its [usage guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) before continuing.\\n\\n## Working with OJS and OMP\\n\\nOJS and OMP load this library as a submodule under `/lib/ui-library/`. In `/js/load.js`, each application loads the components it needs from the UI Library.\\n\\nWhen you are using OJS or OMP from a distributed release package, you will only have a pre-compiled `/js/build.js` file. You will not have the full component library under `/lib/ui-library/`.\\n\\nIf you want to make changes to the components, you will need to use the development repository for [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs) or [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp). Follow the steps described there to setup and install the application.\\n\\n## Compiling for OJS and OMP\\n\\nTo compile the `/js/build.js` file while you are working on the library, run the following command from OJS or OMP's root directory.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run serve\\n```\\n\\nWhen you are done, run the following command to compile an optimized `/js/build.js` for production.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run build\\n```\\n\\n## Global Vue Instance\\n\\nYou may want to modify the global Vue object. This may be necessary if you:\\n\\n- Add custom components\\n- Use third-party plugins\\n- Add global mixins\\n\\nYou can access the global Vue object at `pkp.Vue`.\\n\\nIf a Vue plugin tells you it should be registered with `Vue.use(...)`, you can use `pkp.Vue.use(...)`.\\n\\n*Your intervention will likely happen before Apps are instantiated and mounted, but after the global event bus is instantiated.*\\n\"","export * from
