This feature requires the following:.\\n\\n1. The `ListPanelItem` component has a sub-component of `Orderer` as the first part of the item's template.\\n2. The `ListPanel` component wraps the `ListPanelItem` sub-components in a `draggable` sub-component. (See [Vue.Draggable](https://github.com/SortableJS/Vue.Draggable))\\n3. The `isOrdering` data key is set to `true`.\\n4. To persist the changed order to the database, override the `setItemOrderSequence` method to fire off a post request.\\n5. To cancel ordering and reset the order from the current database values, use the `cancelOrdering` method. It will call the `get` method to repopulate the list.\\n6. To toggle ordering on and off, use the `toggleOrdering` method.\\n\\nWhen ordering can be switched on and off, the list panel should hide any unnecessary details during ordering. The user should be able to do nothing else with the `ListPanel` when ordering. Common components like `Search` and `Filter` are hidden whenever the `-isOrdering` class is added to the `ListPanel`. Use this class to hide any other elements which are not useful during sorting, including those within the `ListItem`.\\n\\n### Ordering Accessibility\\n\\nWhen ordering items, set `tabindex=\\\"-1\\\"` on any unnecessary elements which could otherwise receive focus.

For example, a group of settings tabs might be labeled like this:\\n\\n```html\\n<tabs label=\\\"Website Settings Sections\\\">\\n\\t<tab>...</tab>\\n\\t<tab>...</tab>\\n</tabs>\\n```\\n\\nA `label` is not needed when the tabs immediately follow a heading which describes the tabs. Otherwise a `label` should be used.\\n\\n## Open tab programmatically\\n\\nTabs listen for an `open-tab` event on the global event bus. To open a tab, fire this event and pass the tab `id`:\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('open-tab', 'publication')\\n```\\n\\nThis only works when the tab is visible. If the `publication` tab was nested inside of other tabs and was not visible, it would not be displayed. Consider the following code:\\n\\n```html\\n<tabs>\\n\\t<tab id=\\\"hello\\\" label=\\\"Hello\\\">...</tab>\\n\\t<tab id=\\\"world\\\" label=\\\"World\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tabs>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab id=\\\"lorem\\\" label=\\\"Lorem\\\">...</tab>\\n\\t\\t\\t<tab id=\\\"ipsum\\\" label=\\\"Ipsum\\\">...</tab>\\n\\t\\t</tabs>\\n\\t</tab>\\n</tabs>\\n```\\n\\nIf the `hello` tab is currently visible, firing `pkp.eventBus.$emit('open-tab', 'ipsum')` will not work, because its tab set is not currently visible.\\n\\n## Icon-only Tab Buttons\\n\\nAvoid using icon-only tabs except in rare cases. A text label is almost always easier to understand.\\n\\nYou must still pass a `label` to a `Tab` when using the `icon` property. It will be read out by assistive technology.\\n\\n## Deep Nesting\\n\\nAvoid deeply nesting tabs. The deeper content is nested in tabs, the more work it takes to return to that content when the page is refreshed. Also, it is very difficult to navigate to deeply nested content programmatically.\\n\\nConsider two levels a maximum.

For example, filtering submissions by those in the Review stage will use the `stageIds` parameter for the REST API endpoint.\\n\\nMore than one `Filter` may share the same `param`, but not the same `value`. For example, filtering by the Review and Copyediting stages will use two filters.\\n\\n```html\\n<pkp-filter\\n  label=\\\"Review\\\"\\n  param=\\\"stageIds\\\"\\n  value=\\\"2\\\"\\n  ...\\n/>\\n<pkp-filter\\n  label=\\\"Copyediting\\\"\\n  param=\\\"stageIds\\\"\\n  value=\\\"3\\\"\\n  ...\\n/>\\n```\\n\\n## Managing Active Filters\\n\\nA parent component must manage which filters are active. By convention, this should be in an `activeFilters` object. See the [ListPanel](/#/component/ListPanel) for an example.\\n\\nMost filters should be able to be combined with other filters, so there may be more than one filter active at a time.

You can pass `toolbar`, `plugins` and `init` props to customize the editor. See the [TinyMCE documentation](https://www.tiny.cloud/docs/configure/integration-and-setup/).\\n\\nThe `size` of the input area will signal to the user how much information they should enter into the field.\\n\\nThe default `size` is best for one to two large paragraphs. If you expect a user to enter more than that, consider using the large size when it fits appropriately within the the form where it appears.\\n\\n## Image Uploads\\n\\nThe editor will support image uploads, which are placed in the user's directory in the `public` files directory. You must provide the URL to the public files API and add the plugin and toolbar button.\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tuploadUrl: 'http://journal.com/api/v1/_uploadPublicFile',\\n\\ttoolbar: 'bold italic | link | image',\\n\\tplugins: 'paste,link,image'\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe image upload will _not_ work in this documented example.

This is intended to be used in cases where data can be rendered inside of an email template.\\n\\nWhen an editor is assigning a reviewer, the reviewer's name and the due date can be passed to the editor so that the editor can inject this information directly into the email.\\n\\nIn such cases, the `renderPreparedContent` prop should be set to `true`. This will render the reviewer's name and due date directly into the content as the editor is writing the email.\\n\\nHowever, when editing email templates, we must preserve the placeholders. In such cases, the `renderPreparedContent` prop should be set to `false`. Instead of adding the reviewer's name, a placeholder will be inserted that says `[Reviewer Name]`.\\n\\nThe [Prepared Content](#/component/Form/fields/FieldRichTextarea/ExamplePreparedContent) example shows the placeholders that are used when `renderPreparedContent` is `false`.\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nUse this component for selecting one or more options from a list.

Whenever mounting Vue apps in OJS or OMP, you must use a `Container` or one of the other `Container` elements.\\n\\nThe `Container` element does not have a preset template. It will render whatever template it is mounted to.\\n\\n```html\\n{assign var=\\\"uuid\\\" value=\\\"\\\"|uniqid|escape}\\n<div id=\\\"example-container-{$uuid}\\\">\\n\\t<pkp-form\\n\\t\\tv-bind=\\\"components.masthead\\\"\\n\\t\\t@set=\\\"set\\\"\\n\\t/>\\n</div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\n\\tpkp.registry.init('example-container-{$uuid}', 'Container', {$exampleData|json_encode});\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `Container` component treats the content of the `#example-container-{$uuid}` DOM element as the template. It creates a `<pkp-form>` component and passes the value of `this.components.masthead` as props.\\n\\nThis is the same as mounting a Vue app to the DOM as recommended in Vue's documentation.\\n\\n```js\\nvar app = new Vue({\\n\\t...Container,\\n\\tel: '#example-container-<uuid>',\\n\\tdata: exampleContainerDataInJsonFormat\\n})\\n```\\n\\nWe mount Vue apps using `pkp.registry.init` to make sure that Vue components mounted inside of our legacy JavaScript toolkit do not cause memory leaks.\\n\\n## Child Components\\n\\nAttach as many components to a `Container` as you would like, by passing a `components` array with the initial data.\\n\\n```php\\n$templateMgr->assign('exampleData', [\\n\\t'components' => [\\n\\t\\t'masthead' => [...],\\n\\t\\t'submissions' => [...],\\n\\t]\\n]);\\n```\\n```html\\n{assign var=\\\"uuid\\\" value=\\\"\\\"|uniqid|escape}\\n<div id=\\\"example-container-{$uuid}\\\">\\n\\t<pkp-form\\n\\t\\tv-bind=\\\"components.masthead\\\"\\n\\t\\t@set=\\\"set\\\"\\n\\t/>\\n\\t<submissions-list-panel\\n\\t\\tv-bind=\\\"components.submissions\\\"\\n\\t\\t@set=\\\"set\\\"\\n\\t/>\\n</div>\\n<script type=\\\"text/javascript\\\">\\n\\tpkp.registry.init('example-container-{$uuid}', 'Container', {$exampleData|json_encode});\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nA `Container` is typically used to compose components together into a working app. However, they must also be used when injecting a single Vue.js component into an existing template in the legacy UI system, such as a modal.\\n\\n## Data Management\\n\\n`Container` components exist to manage data for child components. Read about [organizing components in Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Organizing-Components).\\n\\nA child component can update data in the `Container` by emitting a `set` event:\\n\\n```js\\nthis.$emit('set', this.id, {items: newItems});\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<tabs label=\\\"Default demo of tabs component\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"First tab\\\" id=\\\"first\\\" badge=\\\"12\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tFirst tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Second tab\\\" id=\\\"second\\\" badge=\\\"2\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tSecond tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Third tab\\\" id=\\\"third\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThird tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t</tabs>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Tab from '@/components/Tabs/Tab.vue';\\nimport Tabs from '@/components/Tabs/Tabs.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tTab,\\n\\t\\tTabs\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FieldSelect.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\";

Everything else in this repository is only used to run this library.\\n\\n- `/public` Global files that help run the UI Library app. Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n- `/src/components` The component source files. All imports from OJS and OMP should be here.\\n- `/src/docs` The files used to document and preview components.

Not used in OJS and OMP.\\n\\n## Creating a Component Demo\\n\\nEach documented component requires the following:\\n\\n- documented props, data and events,\\n- an example of the component in action\\n- usage guidance\\n\\nThis section will describe the files that are used to document the [HelpButton](#/component/HelpButton) component. You can use this as a guide to documenting your own components.\\n\\nCreate a basic preview of the component:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/previews/PreviewHelpButton.vue -->\\n<template>\\n\\t<help-button\\n\\t\\ttopic=\\\"settings\\\"\\n\\t\\tsection=\\\"workflow-library\\\"\\n\\t\\tlabel=\\\"Learn more about the Publisher Library\\\"\\n\\t/>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport HelpButton from '@/components/HelpButton/HelpButton.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tHelpButton,\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nCreate a `config.js` file that exports default props and describes every prop accepted by the component:\\n\\n```js\\n// /src/docs/components/HelpButton/config.js\\nexport let props = {\\n\\ttopic: 'settings',\\n\\tsection: 'workflow-library',\\n\\tlabel: 'Learn more about the Publisher Library'\\n}\\n\\nexport const propDocs = [\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tkey: 'topic',\\n\\t\\tdescription: 'Which topic to open in the help panel.

In English this should be \\\"Help\\\".'\\n\\t}\\n]\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tprops,\\n\\tpropDocs\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf your component accepts data or emits events, those should be documented and exported as `data`, `dataDocs`, and `emitDocs`.\\n\\nCreate an example of the component:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/ExampleHelpButton.vue -->\\n<script>\\nimport Example from '@/docs/Example.vue';\\nimport PreviewHelpButton from './previews/PreviewHelpButton.vue';\\n// !raw-loader helps us extract the pre-compiled template from the preview\\nimport fileContent from '!raw-loader!./previews/PreviewHelpButton.vue';\\nimport config from './config';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Example,\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tPreviewHelpButton\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\t...config,\\n\\t\\t\\tcomponent: 'preview-help-button',\\n\\t\\t\\tprops: config.props,\\n\\t\\t\\ttemplate: this.extractTemplate(fileContent),\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nNotice how the `config` object is passed to the data. This is used to provide consistent starting props, data, and documentation for all examples of a component.\\n\\nCreate the parent documentation component and pass each example:\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/ComponentHelpButton.vue -->\\n<script>\\nimport Component from '@/docs/Component.vue';\\nimport ExampleHelpButton from './ExampleHelpButton.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Component,\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tExampleHelpButton,\\n\\t},\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tname: 'Help Button',\\n\\t\\t\\texamples: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ExampleHelpButton': 'Base'\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n}\\n</script>\\n```\\n\\nTo create multiple examples for a component, import additional `Example*` components and add them to the `examples` data object.\\n\\nCreate a `readme.md` file to provide usage guidance for the component:\\n\\n```md\\n<!--- /src/docs/components/HelpButton/readme.md --->\\nUse this component to display an icon that will open the help panel when clicked.\\n\\n...\\n```\\n\\nAdd a route to `/src/router.js`:\\n\\n```js\\n...\\nimport ComponentHelpButton from \\\"./docs/components/HelpButton/ComponentHelpButton.vue\\\";\\n\\n...\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tpath: \\\"/component/HelpButton/:example?\\\",\\n\\t\\tname: \\\"HelpButton\\\",\\n\\t\\tcomponent: ComponentHelpButton,\\n\\t},\\n...\\n```\\n\\nFinally, add a link to the library's list of documented components:\\n\\n```html\\n...\\n\\t<li><router-link to=\\\"/component/HelpButton\\\">HelpButton</router-link></li>\\n...\\n```\\n\\n## Linked Components\\n\\nSome components can only be used with a specific parent component. For example, `ListPanelLoadMore` is only used in `ListPanel` components.\\n\\nWhen documenting such components, add an example that demonstrates this relationship and label it \\\"With <name-of-child-component>\\\".\\n\\nSee [ListPanel/ListPanelLoadMore](http://localhost:8080/component/ListPanel/ListPanelLoadMore).\\n\\n## ESLint and Prettier\\n\\nThis library runs ESLint and Prettier to maintain code formatting. When you are running `npm run serve`, any file changes will be linted and errors will be reported in the console.\\n\\nWhen you commit, ESLint and Prettier will run. You will not be able to commit if there are ESLint errors.\\n\\n## Issues\\n\\nIssues for for this library should be opened on the [pkp/pkp-lib](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/) repository. All issues related to OJS and OMP are managed there, including issues with this UI Library.\\n\\n## Pull Requests\\n\\nPull Requests for this library should be opened on the [pkp/ui-library](https://github.com/pkp/ui-library/pulls) repository.\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ListItem.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ListItem.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<pagination\\n\\t\\t:current-page=\\\"currentPage\\\"\\n\\t\\t:last-page=\\\"lastPage\\\"\\n\\t\\t:is-loading=\\\"isLoading\\\"\\n\\t\\t:i18n=\\\"i18n\\\"\\n\\t\\t@set-page=\\\"setPage\\\"\\n\\t/>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport PreviewPagination from './PreviewPagination.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: PreviewPagination,\\n\\tmethods: {\\n\\t\\t/**\\n\\t\\t * Mock a server request delay when changing pages\\n\\t\\t */\\n\\t\\tsetPage(page) {\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.isLoading = true;\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.currentPage = page;\\n\\t\\t\\tsetTimeout(() => {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis.isLoading = false;\\n\\t\\t\\t}, 2000);\\n\\t\\t}\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<tabs label=\\\"Default demo of tabs component\\\">\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"First tab\\\" id=\\\"first\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tFirst tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Second tab\\\" id=\\\"second\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tSecond tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t\\t<tab label=\\\"Third tab\\\" id=\\\"third\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\tThird tab content\\n\\t\\t</tab>\\n\\t</tabs>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Tab from '@/components/Tabs/Tab.vue';\\nimport Tabs from '@/components/Tabs/Tabs.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tTab,\\n\\t\\tTabs\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FormFieldLabel.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./FormFieldLabel.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"# Accessibility\\n\\nSome components require specific markup or special handling based on state to ensure that they are accessible. Component-specific guidelines are outlined within each component's Notes section. The following are broad accessibility guidelines which should be followed.\\n\\n## Focus state and keyboard-based navigation\\n\\nAlways test by navigating components with a keyboard, using <kbd>TAB</kbd> to cycle through elements. Any HTML elements which are not visible should not receive focus. You should be able to see where the focus is on the page at any time.\\n\\nFor example, a [ListPanelFilter](#/component/ListPanel/ListPanelFilter) is hidden until enabled. When hidden, focusable elements such as the filter buttons should be skipped when navigating with the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key.\\n\\nFurthermore, all actions should be possible without a mouse. If drag-and-drop features are used, there should be alternative tools for moving items around when only using a keyboard.\\n\\n### Moving focus\\n\\nAs a general rule, you should *never* move the focus programmatically. This can be disorienting and frustrating for users who rely on keyboard navigation.\\n\\nWe make an exception for this when the user performs an action which indicates a particular focus is desired.\\n\\nFor example, when a button is pressed to open a modal, the focus should be moved into that modal and kept there until the modal is closed. When closed, the focus should be returned to the element which opened the modal.\\n\\n### Avoid tabindex\\n\\nAvoid using `tabindex=\\\"1\\\"` and `tabindex=\\\"2\\\"` to enforce the order of navigation. There are only two occassions when you should use `tabindex`:\\n\\n1. Use `tabindex=\\\"-1\\\"` to prevent an item from receiving focus. You may wish to do this to remove drag-and-drop controls from a keyboard user's tab order, or to prevent the user from having to tab through elements which are currently hidden.\\n2. Use `tabindex=\\\"0\\\"` to allow an item to receive focus when it otherwise would not, such as a `<div>` or `<span>` element. This is useful when you want to move the focus to an element, and want to target a heading or label. (Generally, moving the focus should be avoided. See above.)\\n\\n## Labelling for assistive technology\\n\\nWhen a component uses icons or a visual layout to indicate the meaning of something, you must provide a text label for users without sight. You can use the `-screenReader` class to hide the label from sighted users but still expose it to screen readers.\\n\\nYou should _not_ use `display: hidden`, because screen readers will ignore the text.\\n\\n### Hidden search label\\nA search field often uses an icon to indicate it's purpose. The `placeholder` attribute can not be read by all screen readers, so a label is provided and then hidden from sighted users.\\n\\n<div class=\\\"inlinePreview inlinePreview--accessibleSearch\\\">\\n\\t<span class=\\\"fa fa-search\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"></span>\\n\\t<input id=\\\"searchInput\\\" placeholder=\\\"Search submissions\\\">\\n\\t<label for=\\\"searchInput\\\" class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">\\n\\t\\tSearch submissions\\n\\t</label>\\n</div>\\n\\n```html\\n<icon icon=\\\"search\\\" />\\n<input id=\\\"searchInput\\\" placeholder=\\\"Search submissions\\\">\\n<label for=\\\"searchInput\\\" class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">\\n\\tSearch submissions\\n</label>\\n```\\n\\n### Icon-only buttons\\nIn a few cases, an icon may not need a text label for sighted users to understand it's purpose. A hidden text label that indicates the action and which item the action relates to must be provided for those using screen readers.\\n\\n<div class=\\\"inlinePreview inlinePreview--accessibleButton\\\">\\n\\t<div>\\n\\t\\tMy example submission\\n\\t\\t<button>\\n\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"fa fa-times\\\" aria-hidden=\\\"true\\\"></span>\\n\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">Delete My example submission</span>\\n\\t\\t</button>\\n\\t</div>\\n</div>\\n\\n```html\\n<li>\\n\\tMy example submission\\n\\t<button @click=\\\"deleteSubmission\\\">\\n\\t\\t<icon icon=\\\"times\\\" />\\n\\t\\t<span class=\\\"-screenReader\\\">Delete My example submission</span>\\n\\t</button>\\n</li>\\n```\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nUse this component to display a form. The parent component should respond to the following events:\\n\\n```html\\n<pkp-form\\n\\tv-bind=\\\"formData\\\"\\n\\t@set=\\\"set\\\"\\n/>\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, `formData` will typically be an object compiled from one of the `FormComponent` classes on the server-side.\\n\\n## Multi-page Forms\\n\\nUse a multi-page form when you want to guide the user through a multi-step process that ends in a single action. Reviewer assignment is an example of a multi-step process:\\n\\n1. Select a reviewer\\n2. Select a review type and enter a deadline\\n3. Prepare the notification email\\n\\nWe want to divide the action into smaller steps so that we don't overwhelm the user, but we shouldn't take any action until all steps are complete.\\n\\nDo _not_ use a multi-page form for all related forms, such as those on the settings page. A user may wish to only edit one setting and that change can be saved immediately without depending on further action in related forms.\\n\\nIf you want to indicate that forms are related, without requiring them to be submitted together, use [tabs](#/component/Tab).\\n\\n## Form Submission and Error Handling\\n\\nA `Form` expects to receive a URL to which it can submit a `PUT` or `POST` request to the application's API. Forms can handle the following responses from the API automatically:\\n\\n- A `200` response when successful with a JSON object describing the entity that was added or edited.\\n- A `403` or `404` response when the server refuses the submission with a JSON object describing the error.\\n- A `400` response when a validation error occurs with one of the fields. In this case, a JSON object will be returned with each invalid field as a key and an array of errors for that field.\\n\\nSee the [API Documentation](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/api) for the specification of errors.\\n\\n## Groups and Group Descriptions\\n\\nFields can be organized into groups and given a group title and description. This should be done when fields benefit from the breakdown and when sufficient horizontal space is available.\\n\\nIf a form does not occupy the full workspace (~992px) because it is embedded in a tab or modal, avoid group titles and descriptions to ensure adequate space remains for the form fields.\\n\\n## Conditional Display\\n\\nFields can be shown or hidden based on the value of another field. The `showWhen` prop is used to control conditional display. This prop is documented in the [FieldBase](#/component/Form/fields/FieldBase) example.\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nThis component is a special field for the [PKP Preservation Network](https://pkp.sfu.ca/pkp-pn/) settings.

This might include:\\n\\n- a submission's stage\\n- a user's role\\n- whether a notification is new or read\\n\\nIt is also common to use a badge to display a count of something that is related to an item. Examples might include:\\n\\n- the number of reviews a review is currently undertaking\\n- the number of submissions an editor has been assigned\\n- the number of notifications a user has\\n\\n### Things to avoid\\n\\n**Avoid using too many badges.** Badges should be used to bring attention to key information. If there are too many of them, it will cancel the effect.\\n\\n**Avoid using badges for multiple things in the same space.** A badge works best when it visually links similar attributes of different objects together. Using badges for different kinds of attributes in the same space can make it difficult to determine what each value represents.\\n\\n## Accessibility\\n\\nA badge often relies on its visual proximity to indicate the meaning: a stage badge may appear beside a submission, a count of reviews beside a reviewer. When adding a badge, always include a `label` for those using a screen reader which fully describes it's meaning without requiring the information presented beside it.\\n\\n```html\\n<!-- Example: a badge representing the submission's stage -->\\n<badge label=\\\"Currently in the review stage\\\">\\n\\t{{ stage }}\\n</badge>\\n```\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ListPanelItem.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./ListPanelItem.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<!-- Use the v-bind syntax to bind all props at once. -->\\n\\t<list-panel v-bind=\\\"components.example\\\" @set=\\\"set\\\" />\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Container from '@/components/Container/Container.vue';\\nimport {props} from '../config';\\nimport items from '../helpers/items';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Container,\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t...props,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tid: 'example',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\titems: items,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tdescription:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t'This is an example of description text that can be displayed with the panel.'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<!-- Use the v-bind syntax to bind all props at once. -->\\n\\t<list-panel v-bind=\\\"components.example\\\" @set=\\\"set\\\" />\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Container from '@/components/Container/Container.vue';\\nimport {props} from '../config';\\nimport items from '../helpers/items';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\textends: Container,\\n\\tdata() {\\n\\t\\treturn {\\n\\t\\t\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample: {\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t...props,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tid: 'example',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\titems: items,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcanSelect: true,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcanSelectAll: true,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tselectorType: 'checkbox',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tselected: [],\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tselectorName: 'example',\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttitle: 'List Panel with Select'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\n\\t\\t};\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<div class=\\\"pkpWorkflow\\\" v-cloak>\\n\\t\\t<pkp-header :is-one-line=\\\"true\\\" class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__header\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h1 class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identification\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<badge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tv-if=\\\"submission.status === getConstant('STATUS_PUBLISHED')\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclass=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationStatus\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t:is-success=\\\"true\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPublished\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</badge>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<badge\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tv-else-if=\\\"submission.status === getConstant('STATUS_SCHEDULED')\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tclass=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationStatus\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t:is-primary=\\\"true\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tScheduled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</badge>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationId\\\">{{ submission.id }}</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationDivider\\\">/</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationAuthor\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t{{ currentPublication.authorsStringShort }}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationDivider\\\">/</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<span class=\\\"pkpWorkflow__identificationTitle\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t{{\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlocalizeSubmission(\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcurrentPublication.fullTitle,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcurrentPublication.locale\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t}}\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</span>\\n\\t\\t\\t</h1>\\n\\t\\t\\t<template slot=\\\"actions\\\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<pkp-button\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\telement=\\\"a\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t:label=\\\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsubmission.status === getConstant('STATUS_PUBLISHED')\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t?

Follow the steps described there to setup and install the application.\\n\\n## Compiling for OJS and OMP\\n\\nTo compile the `/js/build.js` file while you are working on the library, run the following command from OJS or OMP's root directory.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run serve\\n```\\n\\nWhen you are done, run the following command to compile an optimized `/js/build.js` for production.\\n\\n```bash\\nnpm run build\\n```\\n\\n## Apps\\n\\nAn app is a root component that manages `data` for child components. Whenever you want to use a Vue.js component in OJS or OMP, it must be controlled by an app.\\n\\nRead about the [`Container`](/#/pages/container) app.\\n\\n## Passing events between Apps\\n\\nWhen two Apps need to communicate with each other, you can use the global event bus. The event bus is an instance of Vue.js so you can use the same [events API](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#Instance-Methods-Events) as any other component.\\n\\nSend a global event.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$emit('submissionUpdated', submission);\\n```\\n\\nRespond to a global event.\\n\\n```js\\npkp.eventBus.$on('submissionUpdated', function (submission) {\\n\\t\\tthis.submission = submission;\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Translations\\n\\nThis library uses a common prop, `i18n`, to pass translation strings from component to component. Usually the `i18n` prop is passed in from the server side when the App component is created.\\n\\nWhen the `i18n` prop is available in any component, you can access it normally.\\n\\n```js\\nvar label = this.i18n.label\\n```\\n\\nIf you need to merge values dynamically with a translated string, you can use the `__()` helper method.\\n\\n```js\\n// this.i18n.label = 'Decline {$submissionTitle}'\\nvar label = this.__('label', {submissionTitle: this.title});\\n```\\n\\nYou can also use this method in component templates.\\n\\n```html\\n<button>\\n\\t{{ __('label', {submissionTitle: title}) }}\\n</button>>\\n```\\n\\nNotice that `this` is dropped when invoking the method and properties in templates.\\n\\n## Multiple Languages\\n\\nAll PKP applications are multilingual. Multilingual fields in objects are provided as a JSON object with keys specifying the locale codes. The following response shows the title property of a submission in English and Canadian French.\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n\\t\\\"title\\\": {\\n\\t\\t\\\"en_US\\\": \\\"Young people from an immigrant background and their choice of post-secondary orientation in Montreal\\\",\\n\\t\\t\\\"fr_CA\\\": \\\"Jeunes issus de l’immigration et choix d’orientation au postsecondaire à Montréal\\\"\\n\\t},\\n\\t...\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAll components include a helper method, `localize()`, which helps you retrieve a value in the correct language.\\n\\n```js\\nvar title = this.localize(this.title);\\n```\\n\\nThis will return the value in the user's current language or the primary language of the site. If it doesn't exist in either of these locales, it will return the first locale it finds.\\n\\nYou can also request a specific locale.\\n\\n```js\\nvar title = this.localize(this.title, 'fr_CA');\\n```\\n\\n## CSRF Token\\n\\nAny component which sends a `PUT`, `POST` or `DELETE` request to an OJS or OMP API endpoint _must_ include a [CSRF token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) in the header.\\n\\nYou will need to generate the CSRF token on the server and pass it to your component. You can then add this to the header of a jQuery ajax request.\\n\\n```js\\n$.ajax({\\n\\theaders: {\\n\\t\\t'X-Csrf-Token': this.csrfToken,\\n\\t},\\n\\t...\\n});\\n```\\n\\n## Global Vue Instance\\n\\nYou may want to modify the global Vue object. This may be necessary if you:\\n\\n- Add custom components\\n- Use third-party plugins\\n- Add global mixins\\n\\nYou can access the global Vue object at `pkp.Vue`.\\n\\nIf a Vue plugin tells you it should be registered with `Vue.use(...)`, you can use `pkp.Vue.use(...)`.\\n\\n*Your intervention will likely happen before Apps are instantiated and mounted, but after the global event bus is instantiated.*\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/less-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--10-oneOf-1-3!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./StatsContainer.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=less&\";

You can write a `<table>` in plain HTML code for better performance. Use the class name, `pkpTable`, to apply consistent styles to your table.\\n\\n## Datagrid\\n\\nThis component implements a [Data Grid](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/grid/dataGrids.html), which provides accessible keyboard controls and markup for managing the data in the table.\\n\\nWhen using this component with a custom row slot, pay special attention to the use of `tabindex` and `scope=\\\"row\\\"` to ensure your table cells remain compliant with the Data Grid spec.\\n\\nAll interactions in the table rows, including buttons or fields to edit a row, must be accessible by keyboard. Navigation with the up, down, left and right arrows should not be impacted by any interactive elements in a row.\\n\\nIf you extend this component with your own template, be sure to include accessible labeling. When appropriate, use the `scope` and `aria-sort` attributes in the header cells.\\n\\n## External Labelling\\n\\nYou may wish to label the table with text that is not part of the table itself. In this case, the `labelledBy` prop must be used to link the table to its label. If you have an additional description, you must use the `describedBy` prop to link this description to the table.\\n\\nSee the [Labelled By](#/component/Table/LabelledBy) example.\\n\\n## Slots\\n\\nThis component supports two kinds of slots for extending the template. Read the [Vue.js documentation about slots](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html).\\n\\nExamples of the slots in use can be seen in the [Custom Header](#/components/Table/examples/with-header) and [Custom Column](#/components/Table/examples/with-column) examples.\\n\"","module.exports = \"<template>\\n\\t<badge label=\\\"View all layout editors\\\" isButton=\\\"true\\\">\\n\\t\\tLayout Editor\\n\\t</badge>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nimport Badge from '@/components/Badge/Badge.vue';\\n\\nexport default {\\n\\tcomponents: {\\n\\t\\tBadge\\n\\t}\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","module.exports = \"\\nUse this component to display an icon that will open the help panel when clicked.\\n\\n## Usage Recommendations\\n\\nUse the help panel when **instructions** for completing actions require further information, such as a description of when one choice should be made over another.
