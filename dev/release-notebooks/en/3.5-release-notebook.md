# Release Notebook for OJS/OMP/OPS 3.5

> Ready to upgrade? Read our guide on [how to upgrade](/dev/upgrade-guide/en/).
{:.notice}

OJS, OMP and OPS version 3.5 were released on June 16, 2025. This release notebook provides technical guidance on changes that will impact software developers, plugin and theme authors, and anyone who works with the application codebase.

## Long-Term Support (LTS) and Short-Term Support (STS)

PKP alternates between releases of Long-Term Support (LTS) and Short-Term Support (STS) for major releases of OJS, OMP, and OPS.

OJS, OMP, and OPS 3.5.0 will become PKP's next Long-Term Support (LTS) releases **when, but not until, the LTS designation is added to 3.5.0 on the download page** ([OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/download/); [OMP](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/omp/download/); [OPS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ops/download/)). This indicates to the community that these releases will be kept reliable, stable, and predictable for a period of 3 to 5 years.

When the LTS designation is added to 3.5.0, **users can expect to have 12 months to plan and execute the upgrade from 3.3.0 LTS to 3.5.0 LTS**. After one year, 3.3.0 will reach end-of-life and **will no longer be maintained** for security or reliability.

> If you are upgrading from 3.3.0 LTS to 3.5.0 LTS, you will need to accommodate the changes required to upgrade to 3.4.0 **and** the changes documented here. See the [3.4.0 Release Notebook](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/dev/release-notebooks/en/3.4-release-notebook) for details on the 3.3.0 to 3.4.0 upgrade.

## Hosting and Deployment

### Configuration File Changes

Changes to the configuration file are documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/stable-3_5_0/docs/release-notes/README-3.5.0).

A new setting in `[general]` called `app_key` will be generated and added during the upgrade process. If the key cannot be generated during upgrade, there is a command-line tool that can be used instead: `lib/pkp/tools/appKey.php` ([details](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9895)).

There are several new options and some settings have been removed. All new settings have sensible defaults; no manual intervention is required in the configuration file when upgrading.

### Hosting Environment

OJS/OMP/OPS 3.5.0 require at least PHP 8.2.0.

## Import/Export

- The affiliation element has changed. See [#7135](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7135) for details.
- The user export XML has changed the way that affiliations are treated. See [#10963](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/pull/10963) for details.
- The user export and import XML considers roles history, start, end date, and masthead. See [#11479](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/11479) for details.
- *OMP only*: The ONIX schema version has been updated. In some metadata fields (e.g. for Publication Formats or Marketing), metadata values in lists will appear as "Discontinued". This means they have been deprecated in the Onix schema and should no longer be used, but are included for backwards compatibility.

## New Features/Tools

### External Vocabulary Support

Hook-based support for external vocabularies has been implemented with [#1550](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/1550). For examples of plugins that use this functionality, see [Frascati](https://github.com/asmecher/frascati/blob/main/classifications.xml) and [External Vocab Plugin Template](https://github.com/jyhein/externalVocab).

### Invitations

A new abstract toolset for implementing various kinds of emailed invitations has been added with [#9197](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9197). This is used in the 3.5.0 codebase to implement three types of invitations:

- The ability to request an email address change (and confirm it using the invitation toolset)
- The one-click reviewer access invitation (previously implemented using the "access keys" toolset, which has been rolled into this feature)
- The new GDPR-compliant user account creation process.

This toolset will be used increasingly in future releases. It's useful in situations where you need to send an email-based request that will only take effect when the invited user accepts (or declines) the invitation.

## Code Changes

### Localization

PKP is aligning our list of UI locales with the upstream list used by Weblate (and maintained as part of that project). In support of this, several locales were renamed in order to standardize them against the Weblate list. See [#9707](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9707) for details.

Starting with OJS/OMP/OPS 3.5.0, the list of UI locales and the list of metadata locales may diverge.

The user's current locale is now part of the URL for page-based requests (see [#699](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/699)). This change is backwards-compatible; URLs without a specified locale will direct to the appropriate content.

### User Interface

OJS, OMP, and OPS have migrated [from Vue v2 to Vue v3](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/8919) with version 3.5.0. With this change, the Vue Options API is deprecated [in favour of the Composition API](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-technical-roadmap--docs#vue3-composition-api-35). Likewise, mixins are [deprecated in favour of composables](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/composables-usefetch--docs).

The [page architecture has been updated](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-page-architecture--docs), and the use of Smarty for editorial pages [is deprecated](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-technical-roadmap--docs#vuejs--smarty---vuejs-35). Tailwind CSS [is now available](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-style-introduction--docs) the new editorial UI.

There are [new instructions](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-plugins--docs) for coding plugins that wish to use Vue components.

It is [no longer necessary to pass translations into components through `props`](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-translation--docs).

The `ListPanel` component [has been deprecated](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/components-table--docs) in favour of the new Table component for new Listings/Managers.

For full details on new standards and tools for UI coding, please see [Storybook](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/).

The locations of several front-end Javascript dependencies -- JQuery/JQueryUI, JQuery Validation, and ChartJS -- [have moved](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9753).

### Deprecated Behaviours

Several behaviours that were deprecated in OJS/OMP/OPS 3.4.0 have been removed in 3.5.0 and will no longer work. These are documented below.

#### Miscellaneous Changes

- The `HANDLER_CLASS` constant is no longer used to direct OJS/OMP/OPS to load a 3rd-party handler class. There is a hook parameter (introduced but not required in OJS/OMP/OPS 3.4.0) that may be used instead, both for page and component handlers.
- All path parameters passed to `Request::url` or `Request::redirect` functions (or their `Dispatcher` equivalents) should be arrays. Previous releases accepted strings or arrays. Where strings were previously used, you can simply wrap them in `[]` to convert to an array.
- The Pimple dependency injection library has been replaced with Laravel's dependency injection toolkit. See [#9913](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9913) for details. This affects uses of the `Services` and `PKPServices` classes.

#### Unsupported Hooks

The following hooks have been removed and attempts to register against them will result in an error:

- Related to submission lists: `API::_submissions::params`, `Template::Workflow::Publication`, `Template::Workflow`, `Workflow::Recommendations`
- `APIHandler::endpoints`
- `Mail::send`
- `EditorAction::modifyDecisionOptions`, `EditorAction::recordDecision`
- Hooks related to storage changes: `Announcement::getProperties`, `Author::getProperties::values`, `EmailTemplate::getProperties`, `Galley::getProperties::values`, `Issue::getProperties::fullProperties`, `Issue::getProperties::summaryProperties`, `Issue::getProperties::values`, `Publication::getProperties`, `Section::getProperties::fullProperties`, `Section::getProperties::summaryProperties`, `Section::getProperties::values`, `Submission::getProperties::values`, `SubmissionFile::getProperties`, `User::getProperties::fullProperties`, `User::getProperties::reviewerSummaryProperties`, `User::getProperties::summaryProperties`, `User::getProperties::values`, `Announcement::getMany::queryBuilder`, `Announcement::getMany::queryObject`, `Author::getMany::queryBuilder`, `Author::getMany::queryObject`, `EmailTemplate::getMany::queryBuilder`, `EmailTemplate::getMany::queryObject::custom`, `EmailTemplate::getMany::queryObject::default`, `Galley::getMany::queryBuilder`, `Issue::getMany::queryBuilder`, `Publication::getMany::queryBuilder`, `Publication::getMany::queryObject`, `Stats::getOrderedObjects::queryBuilder`, `Stats::getRecords::queryBuilder`, `Stats::queryBuilder`, `Stats::queryObject`, `Submission::getMany::queryBuilder`, `Submission::getMany::queryObject`, `SubmissionFile::getMany::queryBuilder`, `SubmissionFile::getMany::queryObject`, `User::getMany::queryBuilder`, `User::getMany::queryObject`, `User::getReviewers::queryBuilder`, `CategoryDAO::_fromRow`, `IssueDAO::_fromRow`, `IssueDAO::_returnIssueFromRow`, `SectionDAO::_fromRow`, `UserDAO::_returnUserFromRow`, `UserDAO::_returnUserFromRowWithData`, `UserDAO::_returnUserFromRowWithReviewerStats`, `UserGroupDAO::_returnFromRow`, `ReviewerSubmissionDAO::_fromRow`, `UserGroup::delete::before`, `UserGroup::delete`
- Statistics-related: `API::stats::publication::abstract::params`, `API::stats::publication::galley::params`, `API::stats::publications::abstract::params`, `API::stats::publications::galley::params`
- Localization-related: `PKPLocale::installLocale`, `PKPLocale::registerLocaleFile`, `PKPLocale::registerLocaleFile::isValidLocaleFile`, `PKPLocale::translate`
- `API::submissions::files::params`
- `ArticleGalleyDAO::getLocalizedGalleysByArticle`
- `PluginGridHandler::plugin`, `PluginGridHandler::plugin`
- `SubmissionFile::assignedFileStages`, `SubmissionHandler::saveSubmit`
- `AcronPlugin::parseCronTab` ([#9678](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9678))
- `Announcement::delete::before`, `Announcement::delete`, `Announcement::Collector` ([#10328](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/10328))
- `CitationDAO::afterImportCitations`

### Namespaces and PSR4

- Plugin classes with the `.inc.php` file extension are no longer supported. (All PHP code should use the `.php` file extension.)
- Plugins without namespaces are no longer supported. All plugin classes should be namespaced.

### Error handling

The `fatalError` function has been removed. Code that previously made use of this function should now throw exceptions instead.

### Strings

String-related coding standards have been cleaned up as we consolidate on modern PHP and make better use of the Laravel ecosystem's tools:

- The third-party [Stringy library](https://github.com/danielstjules/Stringy) has been removed from the set of Composer dependencies. Instead, use the [Laravel `Str` class](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/strings), which provides equivalents for most functions.
- Many of the `PKPString` functions, which were deprecated wrappers around other libraries' functions, have been removed. Use Laravel's `Str` class instead.
- The `..._codesafe` string functions have been removed. Now that a PHP8.2 baseline is required, the affected functions [are no longer locale-dependent](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/10164) and can be used without locale-specific considerations.

### Database and ORM

#### Eloquent Adoption

PKP is gradually adopting Laravel's [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent) and [Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queries) as its preferred approach to database interactions. Over time we will replace legacy DAO classes with newer patterns using these tools. In 3.5.0, the following entities have been refactored to use an Eloquent model:

- [Announcements](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/announcement/Announcement.php)
- [Controlled Vocabularies](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/controlledVocab/ControlledVocab.php) (and related entities, including [User Interests](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/user/interest/UserInterest.php))
- [Email Logs](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/log/EmailLogEntry.php)
- [Notes](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/note/Note.php)
- [Notifications](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/notification/Notification.php)
- [Publication Categories](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/publication/PublicationCategory.php)
- [Queries / Discussions](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/query/Query.php)
- [Stage Assignments](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/stageAssignment/StageAssignment.php)
- [User Groups](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/userGroup/UserGroup.php)

Code that used the previous DAO-based implementations, including related hooks, will need to be refactored.

#### Review Assignments

Review assignments were refactored from the deprecated DAO pattern to the Repository / `EntityDAO` pattern. To get a review assignment by ID use:
```php
$reviewAssignment = Repo::reviewAssignments()->get($id)
```
ReviewAssignmentDAO was removed and attempts to use it will cause an error.

### Task Scheduler Changes

The following major changes have been made to the Task Scheduler:

- The XML based scheduled task list has been [removed in favour of Laravel's Task Scheduler](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9678).
- The `tools/runScheduledTasks.php` script has been replaced with `lib/pkp/tools/scheduler.php` . Those who added `runScheduledTasks.php` to their cron schedule (or equivalent) should use `php lib/pkp/tools/scheduler.php run` instead.
- A new `[schedule]` section has been added to the `config.inc.php` configuration file for better control of the task scheduler. See [#9678](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9678#issue-2110219392) or check [config.TEMPLATE.inc.php](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/stable-3_5_0/config.TEMPLATE.inc.php) for more details.
- [Acron](https://github.com/pkp/acron) plugin has been deprecated and removed.
- Plugins that wish to register scheduled tasks should use Laravel scheduler conventions instead of the XML-based format that was previously supported. See [#9678](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9678#issue-2110219392) for details, and the [PKP Preservation Network](https://github.com/pkp/pln) plugin as a reference.

### Improvement of Job Runner Configuration

A new `process_jobs_at_task_scheduler` setting has been introduced in the `[job_runner]` section of `config.inc.php` to [better control how jobs get processed by the job runner](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9823). This helps prevent large numbers of jobs from getting processed simultaneously when using the web-based job runner and scheduled task runner. The command-line scheduled task runner has been similarly improved.

## REST API Changes

The following major changes have been made to the REST API:

- The backend submissions handler (`_submissions`) was extended to support refactored submission listings and review assignments.
- API handling has been [migrated from the Slim microframework to Laravel](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7698#issue-1132905079). Third-party additions/modifications to the API that made use of Slim features must be migrated to Laravel's routing toolkit.
- Plugins wishing to modify the handling of requests to existing API endpoints should follow [a new hook-based pattern](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9434).

See all the changes in [3.5 API Reference](/dev/api/ojs/3.5.html).
