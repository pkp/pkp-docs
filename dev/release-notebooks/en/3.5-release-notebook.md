{:.notice}

OJS, OMP and OPS version 3.5 were released on **RELEASE DATE HERE**. This release notebook provides technical guidance on changes that will impact software developers, plugin and theme authors, and anyone who works with the application codebase.

## Long-Term Support (LTS) and Short-Term Support (STS)

PKP alternates between releases of Long-Term Support (LTS) and Short-Term Support (STS) for major releases of OJS, OMP, and OPS.

OJS, OMP, and OPS 3.5.0 will become PKP's next Long-Term Support (LTS) releases **when, but not until, the LTS designation is added to 3.5.0 on the download page** ([OJS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ojs/download/); [OMP](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/omp/download/); [OPS](https://pkp.sfu.ca/software/ops/download/)). This indicates to the community that these releases will be kept reliable, stable, and predictable for a period of 3 to 5 years.

When the LTS designation is added to 3.5.0, **users can expect to have 12 months to plan and execute the upgrade from 3.3.0 LTS to 3.5.0 LTS**. After one year, 3.3.0 will reach end-of-life and **will no longer be maintained** for security or reliability.

## Hosting and Deployment

### Configuration File Changes

Changes to the configuration file are documented in the [release notes](https://github.com/pkp/ojs/blob/stable-3_5_0/docs/release-notes/README-3.5.0).

A new setting in `[general]` called `app_key` will be generated and added during the upgrade process. If the key cannot be generated during upgrade, there is a command-line tool that can be used instead: `lib/pkp/tools/appKey.php` ([details](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9895)).

There are several new options and some settings have been removed. All new settings have sensible defaults; no manual intervention is required in the configuration file when upgrading.

### Hosting Environment

OJS/OMP/OPS 3.5.0 require at least PHP 8.2.0.

## New Features/Tools

### Invitations

A new abstract toolset for implementing various kinds of emailed invitations has been added with [#9197](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9197). This is used in the 3.5.0 codebase to implement three types of invitations:

- The ability to request an email address change (and confirm it using the invitation toolset)
- The one-click reviewer access invitation (previously implemented using the "access keys" toolset, which has been rolled into this feature)
- The new GDPR-compliant user account creation process.

This toolset will be used increasingly in future releases. It's useful in situations where you need to send an email-based request that will only take effect when the invited user accepts (or declines) the invitation.

## Code Changes

### User Interface

OJS, OMP, and OPS have migrated [from Vue v2 to Vue v3](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/8919) with version 3.5.0. With this change, the Vue Options API is deprecated [in favour of the Composition API](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-technical-roadmap--docs#vue3-composition-api-35). Likewise, mixins are [deprecated in favour of composables](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/composables-usefetch--docs).

The [page architecture has been updated](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-page-architecture--docs), and the use of Smarty for editorial pages [is deprecated](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-technical-roadmap--docs#vuejs--smarty---vuejs-35). Tailwind CSS [is now available](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-style-introduction--docs) the new editorial UI.

There are [new instructions](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-plugins--docs) for coding plugins that wish to use Vue components.

It is [no longer necessary to pass translations into components through `props`](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/guide-translation--docs).

The `ListPanel` component [has been deprecated](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/?path=/docs/components-table--docs) in favour of the new Table component for new Listings/Managers.

For full details on new standards and tools for UI coding, please see [Storybook](https://stable-3_5_0--6555d3db80418bb1681b8b17.chromatic.com/).

The locations of several front-end Javascript dependencies -- JQuery/JQueryUI, JQuery Validation, and ChartJS -- [have moved](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9753). 

### Deprecated Code Removal

Several behaviours that were deprecated in OJS/OMP/OPS 3.4.0 have been removed in 3.5.0 and will no longer work. These are documented below.

#### Unsupported Hooks

The following hooks have been removed and attempts to register against them will result in an error:

- Hook::addUnsupportedHooks('API::_submissions::params', 'Template::Workflow::Publication', 'Template::Workflow', 'Workflow::Recommendations'); // pkp/pkp-lib#10766 Removed with new submission lists for 3.5.0

- Localization-related: `PKPLocale::installLocale`, `PKPLocale::registerLocaleFile`, `PKPLocale::registerLocaleFile::isValidLocaleFile`, `PKPLocale::translate`
- 'API::submissions::files::params'
- `ArticleGalleyDAO::getLocalizedGalleysByArticle`
- `PluginGridHandler::plugin`, `PluginGridHandler::plugin`
- `SubmissionFile::assignedFileStages`, `SubmissionHandler::saveSubmit`
- `AcronPlugin::parseCronTab` ([#9678](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9678))
- `Announcement::delete::before`, `Announcement::delete`, `Announcement::Collector` ([#10328](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/10328))

### Namespaces and PSR4

- Plugin classes with the `.inc.php` file extension are no longer supported. (All PHP code should use the `.php` file extension.)
- Plugins without namespaces are no longer supported. All plugin classes should be namespaced.

### Strings

String-related coding standards have been cleaned up as we consolidate on modern PHP and make better use of the Laravel ecosystem's tools:

- The third-party [Stringy library](https://github.com/danielstjules/Stringy) has been removed from the set of Composer dependencies. Instead, use the [Laravel `Str` class](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/strings), which provides equivalents for most functions.
- Many of the `PKPString` functions, which were deprecated wrappers around other libraries' functions, have been removed. Use Laravel's `Str` class instead.
- The `..._codesafe` string functions have been removed. Now that a PHP8.2 baseline is required, the affected functions [are no longer locale-dependent](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/10164) and can be used without locale-specific considerations.

### Database and ORM

#### Eloquent Adoption

PKP is gradually adopting Laravel's [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/eloquent) and [Query Builder](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/queries) as its preferred approach to database interactions. Over time we will replace legacy DAO classes with newer patterns using these tools. In 3.5.0, the following entities have been refactored to use an Eloquent model:

- [Announcements](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/announcement/Announcement.php)
- [Controlled Vocabularies](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/controlledVocab/ControlledVocab.php) (and related entities, including [User Interests](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/user/interest/UserInterest.php))
- [Email Logs](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/log/EmailLogEntry.php)
- [Notes](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/note/Note.php)
- [Notifications](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/notification/Notification.php)
- [Publication Categories](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/publication/PublicationCategory.php)
- [Queries / Discussions](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/query/Query.php)
- [Stage Assignments](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/stageAssignment/StageAssignment.php)
- [User Groups](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/blob/stable-3_5_0/classes/userGroup/UserGroup.php)

Code that used the previous DAO-based implementations, including related hooks, will need to be refactored.

#### Review Assignments

Review assignments were refactored from the deprecated DAO pattern to the Repository / `EntityDAO` pattern. To get a review assignment by ID use:
```php
$reviewAssignment = Repo::reviewAssignments()->get($id)
```
ReviewAssignmentDAO was removed and attempts to use it will cause an error.

## REST API Changes

The following major changes have been made to the REST API:

- The backend submissions handler (`_submissions`) was extended to support refactored submission listings and review assignments.
- API handling has been [migrated from the Slim microframework to Laravel](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/7698#issue-1132905079). Third-party additions/modifications to the API that made use of Slim features must be migrated to Laravel's routing toolkit.
- Plugins wishing to modify the handling of requests to existing API endpoints should follow [a new hook-based pattern](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/9434).

See all the changes in [3.5 API Reference](/dev/api/ojs/3.5.html).
