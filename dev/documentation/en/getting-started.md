# Getting Started

This section will describe how to install the application, contribute changes, and stay up-to-date with the latest changes.

> This guide assumes that you know how to run a local server, work with git version control and run tools from the command line.
{:.warning}

## Technical Requirements

- PHP 7.0+
- MySQL 4.1+ _or_ PostgreSQL 9.1.5+

## Install

Fork and clone the [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs) or [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp) repository on GitHub. (How to [fork and clone a repository on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).)

From your terminal, navigate to the application's root directory and run the following command to check out the submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Copy the default config file.

```
cp config.TEMPLATE.inc.php config.inc.php
```

Open the `config.inc.php` file, find the database settings, and update them to match the credentials for your SQL server.

Install dependencies with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer --working-dir=lib/pkp update
composer --working-dir=plugins/paymethod/paypal update
```

Run the following command if you are installing OJS.

```
composer --working-dir=plugins/generic/citationStyleLanguage update
```

Install dependencies with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the following command to launch the application using PHP's built-in server.

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Load your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to install the application.

## Branches

Published versions of the software can be found in branches in the git repository. For example, run the following command to check out version 3.1.2 of the software.

```
git checkout stable-3_1_2
```

## Remotes

To get changes to the application that were made after you forked, add the `upstream` remote.

For OJS:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ojs.git
cd lib/pkp
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/pkp-lib.git
cd ../ui-library
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ui-library.git
cd ../..
```

For OMP:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/omp.git
cd lib/pkp
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/pkp-lib.git
cd ../ui-library
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ui-library.git
cd ../..
```

Run the following commands whenever you want to pull the latest changes to your repository.

```
# Update the app
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push

# Update the pkp-lib submodule
cd lib/pkp
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push

# Update the ui-library submodule
cd ../ui-library
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push

cd ../..
```

## Updates

When you have pulled down changes from the `upstream` remote, run the following to sync the `lib/pkp` and `lib/ui-library` submodules.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You may need to update dependencies and rebuild the JavaScript package.

```
composer --working-dir=lib/pkp update
npm install
npm run build
```

Sometimes a code change will modify the database structure and you will need to run the upgrade script.

```
php tools/upgrade.php upgrade
```

## Contributions

All contributions should be written in a branch and pushed to your fork. Then open a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) to PKP's repository.

Now that you're up and running, learn more about the [application architecture](./architecture).
