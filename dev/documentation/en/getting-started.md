# Getting Started

> This guide assumes that you know how to run a local server, work with git version control and run tools from the command line.
{:.warning}

This section will describe how to install the application in a local development environment and stay up-to-date with the latest changes. It is intended for developers who want to work with the source code. Read the [Admin Guide](../../../admin-guide/) to learn how to install and host the application in a production environment.

## System Requirements

> If you are using Windows, you may need to install GNU Patch and add it to your system's `PATH` environment variable.
{:.notice}

The Admin Guide describes the [system requirements](../../../admin-guide/en/getting-started#system-requirements). When running locally, many of the recommended dependencies are not required.

## Install

Fork and clone the [OJS](https://github.com/pkp/ojs), [OMP](https://github.com/pkp/omp), or [OPS](https://github.com/pkp/ops) repository on GitHub. (Read more about [forking and cloning a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) on GitHub).

```
git clone https://github.com/pkp/ojs --recurse-submodules -b stable-3_5_0
```

(Use `omp` or `ops` in place of `ojs`, depending on which application you wish to check out. The `stable-3_5_0` part of the command is the branch to check out; make sure to choose the branch you want to develop against. See [Branches](#branches) for more information.)

Next, copy the default config file:

```
cp config.TEMPLATE.inc.php config.inc.php
```

Open the `config.inc.php` file, find the database settings, and update them to match the credentials for your SQL server.

```
[database]

driver = <driver>   # mysql or postgres9
host = <host>       # usually `localhost`
username = <user>
password = <pass>
name = <db>
```

Find the `[email]` settings in the config file and route emails to the server `log` or a [local SMTP server](./resources#log-emails).

```
[email]

; Default method to send emails
; Available options: sendmail, smtp, log
default = log
```

Install dependencies with [composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```
composer --working-dir=lib/pkp install
composer --working-dir=plugins/generic/citationStyleLanguage install
```

Run the following command if you are installing OJS or OMP.

```
composer --working-dir=plugins/paymethod/paypal install
```

Install dependencies and build the JavaScript package with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Run the following command to launch the application using PHP's built-in server.

```
php -S localhost:8000
```

Load your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to install the application.

## Branches

Published versions of the software can be found in branches in the git repository. For example, run the following command to check out the latest 3.5.0-x version of the software.

```
git checkout stable-3_5_0
```

For any customization work, base your own branches on one of the stable branches. That should make it easier to maintain compatibility with plugins and future updates, and it locks down all dependencies to the versions used at the time of release. This is not true of the `main` branch, introducing the danger of incompatibilities between future versions of those dependencies, preventing successful builds of OJS/OMP/OPS at that point.

> ⚠️  When changing branches, make sure to change submodule branches too.
{:.warning}

## Remotes

To get changes to the application that were made after you forked, add the `upstream` remote.

For OJS:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ojs.git
cd lib/pkp
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/pkp-lib.git
cd ../ui-library
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ui-library.git
cd ../..
```

For OMP:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/omp.git
cd lib/pkp
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/pkp-lib.git
cd ../ui-library
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ui-library.git
cd ../..
```

For OPS:

```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ops.git
cd lib/pkp
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/pkp-lib.git
cd ../ui-library
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pkp/ui-library.git
cd ../..
```

Run the following commands whenever you want to pull the latest changes to your repository.

```
# Update the app
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push

# Update the pkp-lib submodule
cd lib/pkp
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push

# Update the ui-library submodule
cd ../ui-library
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
git push

cd ../..
```

## Updates

When you have pulled down changes from the `upstream` remote, run the following to sync the `lib/pkp` and `lib/ui-library` submodules.

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

You may need to update dependencies and rebuild the JavaScript package.

```
composer --working-dir=lib/pkp update
npm install
npm run build
```

Sometimes a code change will modify the database structure and you will need to run the upgrade script.

```
php tools/upgrade.php upgrade
```
