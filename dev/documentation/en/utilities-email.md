# Email

Email is sent using [Laravel's Mail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/mail) framework. The `PKP\mail\Mailable` extends Laravel's `Mailable` class to add support for envelope senders, DMARC compliance, and [Email Templates](email-templates).

In its simplest form, you can use the Mailable class directly to compose and send an email.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use PKP\mail\Mailable;

$mailable = new Mailable();
$mailable->from('nate@example.com')
    ->to('vitaliy@example.com')
    ->subject('New submission')
    ->body('A new submission is ready for review.');

Mail::send($mailable);
```

## Mailables

Most emails sent by the application make use of [Email Templates](email-templates) that can be customized for each journal, press or preprint server. To make use of email templates, create a new Mailable for each email.

```php
namespace PKP\mail\mailables;

use PKP\mail\Mailable;

class SubmissionReceived extends Mailable
{
    /** A custom key for the associated email template */
    public const EMAIL_KEY = 'SUBMISSION_RECEIVED';

    /**
     * One or more of the GROUP_ constants
     *
     * This is used to organize mailables in the email management
     * UI shown to journal managers.
     */
    protected static array $groupIds = [
        self::GROUP_SUBMISSION,
    ];

    public function __construct()
    {
        parent::__construct(func_get_args());
    }
}
```

Use the Mailable to compose and send the email.

```php
use APP\facades\Repo;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use PKP\mail\mailables\SubmissionReceived;

$emailTemplate = Repo::emailTemplates()->getByKey(
    $context->getId(),
    SubmissionReceived::EMAIL_KEY
);

$mailable = new SubmissionReceived();
$mailable->from('nate@example.com')
    ->to('vitaliy@example.com')
    ->subject($emailTemplate->getLocalizedData('subject'))
    ->body($emailTemplate->getLocalizedData('body'));

Mail::send($mailable);
```

## Variables

Most [Email Templates](email-templates) make use of variables. For example, the body of an email template may use the following:

```
Thank you for your submission to {$journalName}.
```

The journal's name would be inserted when the email is sent.

```
Thank you for your submission to Journal of Public Knowledge.
```

Pass dependencies to a Mailable's constructor to define the variables that can be used in the email.

```php
namespace PKP\mail\mailables;

use PKP\context\Context;
use PKP\mail\Mailable;
use PKP\submission\Submission;

class SubmissionReceived extends Mailable
{
    /** ... */

    public function __construct(Context $context, Submission $submission)
    {
        parent::__construct(func_get_args());
    }
}
```

The objects passed to the constructor will be transformed into data for the variables.

```php
use PKP\facades\Locale;
use PKP\mail\mailables\SubmissionReceived;

$currentLocale = Locale::getLocale();
$mailable = new SubmissionReceived($context, $submission);

print_r($mailable->getData($currentLocale));
```

```
[
    'journalName' => 'Journal of Public Knowledge',
    'journalUrl' => 'https://journal.com',
    'submissionTitle' => 'Yam diseases and its management in Nigeria',
    'submissionUrl' => 'https://journal.com/workflow/access/15',
    ...
];
```

Use the variables in an email's subject and body.

```php
use APP\facades\Repo;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use PKP\mail\mailables\SubmissionReceived;

$subject = 'New submission to {$journalName}';
$body = 'A new submission is ready to review: {$submissionTitle}.';

$mailable = new SubmissionReceived($context, $submission);
$mailable->from('nate@example.com')
    ->to('vitaliy@example.com')
    ->subject($subject)
    ->body($body);

Mail::send($mailable);
```

```
FROM: nate@example.com
TO: vitaliy@example.com
SUBJECT: New submission to Journal of Public Knowledge

A new submission is ready to review: Yam diseases and its management in Nigeria
```

Get a description of the variables supported by a `Mailable`.

```php
use PKP\mail\mailables\SubmissionReceived;

$supportedVariables = SubmissionReceived::getDataDescriptions();

print_r($supportedVariables);
```

```
[
    'journalName' => 'The name of the journal',
    'journalUrl' => 'The URL to the journal',
    'submissionTitle' => 'The title of the submission',
    'submissionUrl' => 'The URL to the editorial workflow for this submission',
    ...
];
```

### Sender and Recipients

Mailables provide common variables for the sender and recipients, such as `{$senderName}` and `{$recipientName}`. Add the `Recipient` or `Sender` traits to a Mailable class to use these variables.

```php
namespace PKP\mail\mailables;

use PKP\mail\Mailable;
use PKP\mail\mailables\Recipient;
use PKP\mail\mailables\Sender;

class SubmissionReceived extends Mailable
{
    use Recipient;
    use Sender;

    /* ... */
}
```

Use the `sender()` and `recipients()` methods instead of the `from()` and `to()` methods.

```php
use APP\facades\Repo;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;
use PKP\mail\mailables\SubmissionReceived;

$recipients = Repo::users()->getMany($collector);

$mailable = new SubmissionReceived($context, $submission);
$mailable->sender($request->getUser())
    ->recipients($recipients)
    ->subject($subject)
    ->body($body);

Mail::send($mailable);
```

### Custom Variables

A `Mailable` may require variables that are not generated automatically. Add custom variables to a `Mailable` by extending the data and description functions.

```php
namespace PKP\mail\mailables;

use APP\decision\Decision;
use APP\submission\Submission;
use PKP\context\Context;
use PKP\mail\Mailable;
use PKP\mail\traits\Recipient;
use PKP\mail\traits\Sender;

class Example extends Mailable
{
    use Recipient;
    use Sender;

    public const AUTHOR_GUIDELINES = 'authorGuidelines';

    protected Context $context;

    public function __construct(Context $context)
    {
        $this->context = $context;
        parent::__construct(func_get_args());
    }

    public static function getDataDescriptions(): array
    {
        $variables = parent::getDataDescriptions();
        $variables[self::AUTHOR_GUIDELINES] = 'The author guidelines configured by this journal.';

        return $variables;
    }

    public function setData(?string $locale = null)
    {
        parent::setData($locale);
        $this->viewData[self::AUTHOR_GUIDELINES] = $this->context->getData('authorGuidelines', $locale);
    }
}
```

## Unsupported Features

Some of Laravel's `Mailable` features are not supported in this application. Please consider the following when working with mailables.

- Laravel's email localization tools are not supported.
- Do not configure email headers from within the Mailable. Email headers are managed for all outgoing email to ensure compliance with the `envelope_sender` and DMARC configuration options.
- Markdown and Blade templates are not supported. Use the email template variables described above.
- When inspecting `Mailable::$viewData`, the `message` key will appear but this is not a template variable that will be rendered when the email is sent. It is used internally.
- The Illuminate library's `View` class is not used. Use the methods `Mailable::subject()` and `Mailable::body()` to configure the message.
