# Getting started

We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) to test our applications. Before you can run the tests, you will need to [clone and configure](/dev/documentation/en/getting-started) the application's repository so that you have a working installation of the application on your local environment.

## Configure your environment

There are many ways to [configure your environment](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables.html#Setting) to run the Cypress tests. We recommend creating a `cypress.env.json` file.

```json
{
	"baseUrl": "http://localhost:8000",
	"DBTYPE": "****",
	"DBHOST": "****",
	"DBUSERNAME": "****",
	"DBPASSWORD": "****",
	"DBNAME": "****",
	"FILESDIR": "****"
}
```

Replace `****` with the values which match your local installation and place this file in your application's root directory.

> The `DBTYPE` must match one of the options in the installation form. It is usually `mysqli` or `postgres`.
{:.tip}

The integration tests will install the software and create test data.

## Run integration tests

The integration tests will install the software and run a number of tests to add users, make submissions, record editorial decisions and publish articles.

Before the integration tests are run, update your `config.inc.php` file and set the `installed` flag to `Off`.

```
; Set this to On once the system has been installed
; (This is generally done automatically by the installer)
installed = Off
```

Run the following command in the root directory of the application to run the tests.

```
npx cypress run
```

Or open Cypress and watch the tests while they run.

```
npx cypress open
```

![Once Cypress opens, click the Run All Specs button to start the tests.](./cypress-open.gif)

Tests that are shared between the applications are stored in the `lib/pkp/cypress/integration` directory and must be run with a separate command.

```
npx cypress run --config integrationFolder=lib/pkp/cypress/tests/integration
```

## Run PHP Unit tests

Run the unit tests with the following command in your application's root directory.

```
sh lib/pkp/tools/runAllTests.sh
```

The unit tests can be run before or after the integration tests and do not depend on the test data.
