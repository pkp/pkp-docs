# Edit and Create Documentation

Now that you understand the basics of GitHub, this chapter explains how to add new documents and edit documents in the repository.

## Edit a Document

If you want to edit existing documentation or add a section or chapter to existing documentation, you can edit the document directly from the docs repository itself.

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one and log in.
2. Navigate to [the repository in GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs).
3. Follow the directory structure in GitHub until you see the file you want to edit.
4. Click the filename to view that individual file.
5. From there, on the top right of the document window, you should see a small pencil icon.
6. Click that button to open up a plain text editor for the document within GitHub itself.
7. Edit the document.

If your edits requires you to replace or add images, see section on Adding/Replacing images.

## Create a Document

When you create a new document, you need to decided whether to make it a _single page document_ or _multi-page document_, as they are significantly different. Most guides in the Documentation Hub are multi-page documents, which means that each chapter is a different file. However, some short guides are single-page documents.

* [Designing Your Journal](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/designing-your-journal/en/) is an example of a multi-page document.
* [Google Scholar Indexing](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/google-scholar/en/) is an example of a single-page document.

### Single Page Docs

Single page documents are rendered fully from one markdown file. The table of contents on the side of the page is created using the header tags in markdown. For example:

```
## The "Documentation Hub"

### Single Page Docs
```

To create a new single page document in GitHub:

1. In the pkp-docs repository, click Create New File. You will create the new folder for the document as you create the file.
2. Enter the name of the document folder and then /. This will automatically create the folder.
    - _Remember to follow naming conventions_.
3. Enter the name of the file `index.md`.
4. Place the following code at the top of the file:

```
---
generateHeadingToc: true
---
```

From here, write the document out as you would using markdown. Any level two header (e.g.: `## text`) displays on the table of contents on the left as a chapter. Any level three header (e.g.: `### text`) displays as a sub-chapter. Levels four and up does not display on the sidebar table of contents.

> Headings should never skip a level. Do not jump from `## Heading` (2) to `#### Sub-heading` (4). It is important that a sub-heading of `## Heading` (2) is `### Heading` (3) for accessibility.

### Multi-page Docs

Multi-page documents, like [Learning OJS 3](./learning-ojs), are more robust directories with folders for individual languages/translations, and a single markdown file for every chapter of the document. They also contain a file called `SUMMARY.md` that creates the table of contents for the document and a file called `README.md` that serves as a first/landing page for your document. To create a multi-page document start with the following:

1. In the pkp-docs repository, click Create New File. You will create the new folder for the document as you create the file.
2. Enter the name of the document folder and then /. This will automatically create the folder.
   - _Remember to follow naming conventions_. (e.g., if your document is a guide to ORCID, you could name it orcid-guide or orcid-plugin).
3. Enter the name of the file `index.md`.
   - A document-wide `index.md` file should contain a description of the document. Look to other documents as examples. Also, if the document is available in more than one language, they should all be linked from this page.
   - At the top of your indexing file, include the following:

```
---
isBookIndex: true
---
```

Unlike with a single-page document, you no longer need to add to index.md. The rest of your document steps should be as follows:

1. Create a folder for the [language of your document](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm) (eg: en_US, en_CA, fr_CA, fr_FR).
2. Create a file called `SUMMARY.md`
    - `SUMMARY.md` is the file that determines the display of the table of contents for your document. The markdown list hierarchy determines the nesting of contents titles in your sidebar. Each chapter title is written as a link to either a single markdown file per chapter _or_ as a link to a specific heading within that markdown file. You can fill in all of the chapter and section links after you have created the chapter files.
        - a chapter link would look like: `- [Statistics](statistics.md)`
        - a heading inside that chapter would look like: `- [Definitions](./statistics.md#definitions)`

#### Create README file

The next step is to create a README.md file in the language folder for the document. The README file is the main landing page of the document and should contain summary introduction information about the document, so users know what the document is about. It should also contain relevant keywords and descriptive metadata so that users can find the document by searching and the document ranks high in Google search results about the document topics.

Add Title and Description front matter (metadata) to the document, with the Markdown formatting shown in the example below.

- The Title should have the name of the guide in it and any main keywords that would be searched for the document.
- The Description will usually be displayed in the search result, so should give the user a summary of the document and include main keywords that would be searched.
- If either the title or description contain a `:`, they should be put into quotes.

Example:

```
---
title: Technical Documentation - OJS|OMP|OPS
description: A technical guide to the coding conventions and application architecture for Open Journal Systems and Open Monograph Press.
---
```

Example with quotes:

```
---
title: 'Learning OJS 3.3: A Visual Guide to Open Journal Systems'
description: A comprehensive visual guide to all basic functions and configurations related to publishing scholarly articles in Open Journal Systems (OJS).
---
```

Below the front matter, add the H1 title for the page. Since this will be the introduction chapter, the title should be "Introduction: [Document Title.]. For example:

```
# Introduction: Technical Documentation for OJS, OMP, and OPS
```

Now you can add text to the README file. This will be the introduction chapter. It should start with a concise 1-paragraph summary of what the document is about. Then add up to 4 additional paragraphs that further summarize the document's content, including an explanation of who the guide is for and which software applications or versions it applies to. Make sure the text includes all main topics of the document and relevant keywords.

If you want to include extensive background information about the guide or introductory content that exceeds 5 paragraphs or 300-500 words, create a separate chapter for this content with an appropriate title.

Save the README file when it is complete.

#### Create chapter files

Next you can create a separate file for each chapter in the guide and add content to each chapter. Each full chapter of a multi-page document should be a single markdown file.

Every chapter file should have Title front matter (metadata), which can include the document title, and Description front matter, which should give a summary of the document and include main keywords that would be searched. For example, if the document is "Designing Your OJS Journal" and the chapter is "Inclusive and Accessible Theming," the Title could be as follows:

```
---
title: Inclusive and Accessible Themes - Designing Your OJS Journal
description: How to develop inclusive and accessible themes for OJS, including colour, alt text, URLs, and page structure
---
```

If the title contains a `:` character, then the title should be put into quotes, for example:

```
---
title: 'Learning OJS 3.3: A Visual Guide to Open Journal Systems'
---
```

Then add an H1 chapter title and your chapter content below. For any subheadings use descending header tags (H2 to H5). Do not skip a level of header tag, as this affects accessibility.

#### Update table of contents

Once you have created all of your chapters, you can add links to those files in the `SUMMARY.md` file, which essentially creates a table of contents for the document. Whereas your headers in single documents create the sidebar table of contents, in multi-page docs, you need to add the headers manually to the `SUMMARY.md` file.

In the `SUMMARY.md` file, add a link for each chapter title and H2 subheading links below the chapter links.

The first link should be for the Introduction in the README file:
```
* [Introduction](.)
```

## Adding/Replacing images

### Adding Images

Adding images to your documentation helps users more easily locate the features you are writing about. Images should go in a folder named assets. The type of document you’re working on changes where you will find the assets folder.

1. Single-page documents:
    - Find the assets folder within your main document folder. For example: `/contributing/assets/`
2. Multi-page documents:
    - Find the assets folder within the language folder of the document you’re working on. For example: `/learning-ojs/en/assets/`

To add new images to a document, you will need to take and save these screenshots locally. Make sure to follow the naming convention for images.

New assets can be added before working on a document or after it has been completed.

To add assets to a document and assets folder:

1. Add image code in the part of the document you would like this to appear in, [including alt text](#alt-text-for-images). To link to an image in the assets folder you will need to type `“![alt text](./assets/ image file name)”`
   - e.g., `![OJS 3.1 workflow settings components tab.](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-comp.png)`
2. Repeat this step as many times as needed.
3. Create a draft pull request rather than opening a pull request yet
4. Upload assets into the assets folder
   - Go to the branch that has been created for this set of changes.
   - Open the document folder followed by the language folder (if applicable)
   - Open the Assets folder
   - Click the Upload Files button
   - Click Choose Your Files
   - Open the special folder where you saved all of your screenshots
   - Select all of the files and click Open
   - Commit your changes directly to the branch you have been working in
   - Change the status of your draft pull request to ready

![This pull request is still a work in progress notice.](./assets/draft-PR.png)

### Replacing Images

While you’re editing a document you may find that you need to replace an image with an updated screenshot. This might be the case with version updates.

First, take the new screenshot and update the link to the screenshot in the document.

1. Take the new screenshot and save it
2. Before you save the new screenshot, find the link in the document to the old screenshot. It may look something like this:
   - `![alt text](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-jm-settings-workflow-comp.png)`
3. If you’re doing a version update, change the version number in the file name. You would change the above example link to say the following:
    - `![alt text](./assets/learning-ojs3.2-jm-settings-workflow-comp.png)`
4. Copy the part of the link that comes after the last / and before the file type extension - e.g., `learning-ojs3.2-jm-settings-workflow-comp`
5. Go to the new screenshot you just took and save as. Paste the file name you copied in the last step and save the screenshot in a special folder on your desktop.
6. Continue editing the document and save any additional screenshots you take in the same folder and name them in the same way. Once you are finished editing the document, describe your changes at the bottom of the document and click Propose File Change. This will add your changes to a branch. The next page will show Comparing Changes. Create a draft pull request rather than opening a pull request yet. You will upload your screenshot files to the new branch before making a pull request.
   - Go to the branch that has been created for this set of changes.
   - Open the document folder followed by the language folder (if applicable)
   - Open the Assets folder
   - Click the Upload Files button
   - Click Choose Your Files
   - Open the special folder where you saved all of your screenshots
   - Select all of the files and click Open
   - Commit your changes directly to the branch you have been working in
   - Change the status of your draft pull request to ready

![This pull request is still a work in progress notice.](./assets/draft-PR.png)

### Deleting Images

If you’ve replaced images and there is no longer a use for the previous saved asset, the old assets can now be deleted. Before deleting the old assets, look through the chapter to make sure that these are not being used in other sections of the document. If so, update the other links with the new file name. You can then delete the old assets from your branch and create a pull request.

## Alt text for images

Informative images such as screenshots need to have alt text (“alternative text”). Alt text is a machine-readable tag that describes an image in words if the image cannot be viewed for any reason, including slow internet connection, error in the HTML code, or the use of assistive technology.

### Alt text format

`![alt text](./assets/ image file name)`

#### Alt text example 1

`![OJS 3.3 new article notification screen.](./assets/learning-ojs3.3-new-notification.png)`

![OJS 3.3 new article notification screen.](./assets/learning-ojs3.3-new-notification.png)

#### Alt text example 2

`![Creative Commons license types arranged from the most free to the least free.](./assets/journal-policies-cc-licenses.png)`

![Creative Commons license types arranged from the most free to the least free.](./assets/journal-policies-cc-licenses.png)

### Alt text good practices

- Only add alt text for meaningful images, not for decorative ones (decorative images carry no information and serve no purpose other than aesthetics).
- Do not duplicate alt text if the same information is available in the image caption or right before/after the image.
- The recommended number of characters for alt text is 125 characters or less for compatibility with popular screen readers.
- Don’t start alt-text with “Image of…” or “Screenshot of…”, as it’s usually apparent to the user that it’s an image and will be announced by their screen reader.
- All alt text should end with a “.” so that the screen reader will pause after reading.

For further instructions and examples see [WebAim’s Alternative Text guide](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

## Creating Assets Folder

To create an asset folder within the document branch, you will need to create a new file by clicking ‘Create new file’ in your repository.

![Document screen with create new file button pointed out.](./assets/create-assets-folder.png)

This will prompt you to another page where you can edit a new file. On the top you will see:

![Name your file form field.](./assets/create-file-name.png)

Here you will enter the main document folder and the subsequent folders. This will vary depending on whether you are creating an asset folder for a single on multi-page document.

Begin by entering the main folder name followed by ‘/’. You will do this until you reach the subfolder you want to create your asset folder within.In a single-page document the asset folder might be created as the second level folder (i.e., `pkp-docs/contributing/assets/`). In a multi-page document the asset folder might be created within the language folder of the document you are working on. (i.e., `pkp-docs/learning-ojs/en/assets/`).

Multi-page Example:

![Name your file form field for a multi-page document.](./assets/create-file-name-multi.png)

For this example, I have created an assets folder within the en folder of learning-ojs.

Single-page example:

![Name your file form field for a single-page document.](./assets/create-file-name-single.png)

As Github will not allow you to create a blank folder, you will need to create a document in the asset folder. Remember that document pages need to end with ‘.md’

This can be labelled as anything, as it will be deleted after you’ve uploaded your assets. Enter some text into the textbox and commit the change to the file.

![Commit new file screen.](./assets/create-file-holder.png)

You should find your newly created assets folder within the main document folder. Click upload files on the top right corner.

![Assets folder with the upload files button pointed out.](./assets/create-file-upload.png)

Add your assets using drag and drop or by clicking ‘choose your files’

![Files drag and drop screen.](./assets/create-file-upload2.png)

Once you’ve uploaded assets into your assets folder you can go ahead and delete the holder document file you created, by clicking the file name followed by trash can icon on the top right corner.

![Holder screen with the trash can icon pointed out.](./assets/create-file-remove-holder.png)

## Creating a Pull Request

Once you’ve completed the made edits to the file, you will scroll down and fill the information in the text boxes and click ‘Propose file change’.

![Propose file change screen.](./assets/create-PR-1.png)

This will bring you to another page that compares the changes you’ve made.

![Comparing changes screen with compare:patch-16 button pointed out.](./assets/create-PR-compare.png)

The fourth box (highlighted in red) is the branch that’s automatically created by Github.

Click ‘Create pull request.’

This page is where you would enter a more detailed description of what you changed. You might want to do this if you need to justify your changes or need to let everyone else know that a change is significant.

![Open a pull request screen.](./assets/create-open-PR.png)

In this final page, you also have the option to create your pull request or create a draft pull request. A pull request indicates that you have completed your changes and lets the PKP team members know to review your changes. Meanwhile, a draft pull request allows you to continue to make changes.

*If you are a member of the PKP team, you’ll see the ability to commit directly to the main branch*. It’s important to note that these changes are immediate, but they are also unreviewed. Please do not commit directly to main. We recommend that you always commit code via pull request.

## Save and Continue Edits to Branch

Once you’ve created a draft pull request, you can continue making changes to the document you’re working on at any time. It will be important to note which branch is created for that particular document, especially if you have multiple branches in your repository.

![Repository screen with switch branches drop-down open.](./assets/Github-dash-branch-menu.png)

Again, the branch that has been created will be listed on the forth box in the Comparing changes page when generating a pull request.

![Comparing changes screen with compare:patch-16 button pointed out.](./assets/create-branch-name.png)

You can also find out the branch by looking at the PKP Repository, pull request tab. Any active pull requests made can be found in the pkp repository page under pull request. Here you will find both draft pull requests and pull requests made.

![Pull requests tab](./assets/pkp-docs-PR.png)

From your own repository, you will want to select the correct branch and continue making the changes to the document. After making these changes and providing the details of the changes in the textbox. You will want to select the first option to ‘Commit directly to the branch’.

![Commit changes screen with commit directly to the branch option selected.](./assets/PR-Commit-changes-to-branch.png)

You will repeat this step until you’ve complete making your changes.

Once you’ve completed making the changes to your document. You can now go back to the draft pull request you created and click ‘Ready for Review.’

![Pull requests tab with a pull request ready for review.](./assets/PR-ready-review.png)
