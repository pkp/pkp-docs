# Additional Considerations
To ensure long-term sustainability and reliable access, avoid incorporating external dependencies that you cannot manage or preserve. While connecting to third-party APIs or linking directly to externally hosted resources may be convenient, it may be more sustainable to use data, libraries, styles, and media that could be hosted directly within OJS. When referencing external materials, provide standard citations rather than relying on embedded external services.

Common types of external dependencies to be cautious of include:

-   Hosted map services (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap layers served externally)
-   Third-party media hosting platforms (e.g., Vimeo, SoundCloud)
-   Externally hosted JavaScript libraries
-   Web fonts served from external providers (e.g., Google Fonts, Font Library)
-   Direct external links used in place of locally hosted or cited resources
