# What is Multimodal publishing?

Multimodal publishing is part of the evolving landscape of scholarly discourse. Authors and publishers are using a broad range of communication modalities to articulate intricate concepts and foster more effective audience engagement. This approach commonly involves the incorporation of the following elements:

* Images: Often consisting of photographs, diagrams, illustrations, and other visual components to augment comprehension and offer visual representations of data or concepts.
* Audio: Often consisting of recorded speech, interviews, narrated explanations, or sonified data. Audio elements may serve to enhance accessibility and engagement by conveying information through sound. Also, they can support comprehension by clarifying complex concepts, conveying concepts, or offering alternative modes of interpretation.
* Videos: Documenting experiments, capturing real-world phenomena, and demonstrating practical applications of research findings.
* Data visualizations: Displaying intricate datasets and statistical information in interactive and visually compelling formats.
* Interactive features: Facilitating user engagement with the content through simulations, annotations, and other interactive elements, which sometimes involve software code (e.g. javascript).

## Publication resources and intellectual components

When thinking about multimodal publishing, it is recommended to consider multimodal publications in a framework that consists of two key terms: publication resources and core intellectual components. Described as follows:

**Publication resources:** The digital materials that make up the publication. "Resource" does not necessarily refer to a specific file but to the content and form. Some resources may consist of multiple files or be expressed in different formats or galley variants (e.g. HTML, PDF, XML). The publication itself is a resource. If separate from the body of the publication, each of the supporting items are also resources - each figure, graphic, video clip, piece embedded software code, dataset, 3D visualization etc. The publisher may consider working with a preservation service, or another resource with expertise in digital preservation to determine which publication resources are required to represent its core intellectual components, and which files are appropriate to represent each resource.

**Core intellectual components:** The aspects of a publication that are considered integral to the understanding of it. Rather than pertaining to specific digital resources or renditions of a publication, this is a more abstract sense of the facets of the work. For example: the linear text divided by section headings, the media, such as a sound or video clip placed at specific locations within the text, the additional digital resources supplied by the author with descriptive information tied to them. In some cases, these objects, like the core publication itself, may have their own unique metadata, which may be embedded within the object itself or included alongside it. Consideration should also be given to the accessibility of this type of content (e.g. images embedded within a larger article text). For more information related to accessibility, please consult the [creating accessible content guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/accessible-content/). This kind of abstraction and distinction of the core intellectual components of a work is helpful in preservation for communicating requirements and then designing a strategy that covers the important aspects of a work.
