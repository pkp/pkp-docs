# Relevant Plugins for multimodal publishing

Plugins in OJS allow PDF, HTML, and XML files to be viewed in a web browser or downloaded. If the files are being downloaded instead of displayed in the browser, you may need to enable one of these plugins under Website Settings > Plugins. It is recommended to consult the [Plugin guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plugin-inventory/en/#introduction) and verify the suitability for each plugin for your installation (e.g. version compatibility, third party dependencies, etc.). Some plugins that may be relevant for multimodal publishing include:

[Epub viewer](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plugin-inventory/en/#epub-viewer)

[Inline HTML galley](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plugin-inventory/en/#inline-html-galley)

[JATS template](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plugin-inventory/en/#jats-template)

[JATS Parser](https://github.com/Vitaliy-1/JATSParser)

[DocX to JATS converter](https://github.com/Vitaliy-1/docxConverter)

[Lensviewer](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/plugin-inventory/en/#lens-viewer-for-monographs-and-journal-articles)

Other formats may require additional plugins or can be downloaded directly. Alternatively, you may host the full-text content on a different platform and embed a remote URL by choosing the checkbox:This galley will be available at a separate website.
