# Introduction 

Since the advent of digital publishing and digital content creation, researchers and journals have been keen to take advantage of the flexibility of digital content to present scholarship that incorporates interactive and/or multimedia elements, such as video, sound, or other content multimodal publishing refers to this type of published scholarly content.

In addition to audio and visual formats accompanying more traditional text-based articles, which can help to increase the accessibility of journal content, multimodal content is increasingly valued as an alternative form of scholarship reflecting different modes of expression and ways of knowing.

Incorporating audiovisual and interactive elements into scholarly publishing is a way for publishers and researchers to experiment with what it means for audiences to read scholarly output in a digital environment, and offer new dimensions to stories, experiences, art, and research, scholarship.

Many publishing platforms, including Open Journal Systems, have evolved to facilitate the upload and display of multimedia file formats, and many publishers have and/or are eager to put these features into practice.

Despite these moves forward in the use of different formats, it is important to note that effective and sustainable multimodal publishing requires some knowledge of basic web development principles and practices. Although it is possible to rely entirely on third-party services such as video or audio streaming platforms (e.g. Youtube, Soundcloud, Vimeo), those without some experience in web formats and web development may find themselves frustrated when trying to troubleshoot errors or manage content when a service, or particular resource is no longer available. This document will introduce basic principles, but we highly recommend that anyone considering multimodal publishing first ask themselves if they have the time and resources to dedicate to learning basic web development skills, and HTML and CSS in particular, and be willing to apply these skills in the OJS context. This is especially true if you are reading this guide with the intention of incorporating multimedia content into your OJS journal, as OJS allows for a lot of flexibility, freedom, and control, but does not yet provide many shortcuts or tools for building pages intended for general audiences. This same knowledge may be necessary in order to make informed decisions about scholarly communication challenges such as preservation.

**Please note:** this document refers mostly to OJS, as the most widely used PKP software. Many, but not all practices and items discussed throughout may or may not apply to other PKP software (OPS and OMP), depending on the situation.
