# Summary of Better Practices for Journal Metadata

Metadata is an essential aspect of academic publishing. It ensures accurate identification of a journal’s content and can improve discoverability, access, dissemination, preservation, and, arguably, research impact. The most important step to better metadata is due diligence. 

For best results, OJS journals should: 
* Regularly review journal-level metadata and settings. Make sure to check all your settings but, in particular, review: 
  * Administration > Site Settings > Languages
  * Settings > Journal > Masthead and Sections
  * Settings > Workflow > Metadata 
* Provide as much information about your journal as you can in the About the Journal section.
* Review About the Journal regularly to keep it up to date.
* Remember that metadata describes the articles in your publication. It is not a way to manipulate the design or layout of your journal website.
  * Avoid stylistic decisions in journal metadata.
  * Use custom themes instead.
* Be consistent across your publication and make sure your metadata matches your published PDFs.
* Only use one language per metadata field.
* Don't paste metadata directly from word processing software like Microsoft Word.
  * Instead, clear formatting using Notepad (Windows) or pasting without formatting with Option+Command+Shift+V (Mac).
* Review all metadata for articles prior to publication. Once your material is published, any indexing or harvesting services may start pulling your metadata before you have time to make changes.
  * "Measure twice, cut once."
