# Requirements

In order to begin, you must be running ​**Open Journal Systems 3.1.2 or newer**. You must be able to install and regularly update related plugins, which requires server access or a Site Administrator role. (If you don’t have Site Administrator permissions, you can also request that the required plugins be installed by your Site Administrator or institutional service provider.)

If you are not sure what version of OJS you are running, see ​[How do I determine my PKP software’s version](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/t/how-do-i-determine-my-pkp-softwares-version/28534/2)?
