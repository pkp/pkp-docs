# Chapter 1: Introduction

Open Monograph Press \(OMP\) is an open source solution to managing and publishing scholarly monographs online. OMP is a highly flexible editor-operated monograph management and publishing system that can be downloaded for free and installed on a local Web server.

It has been designed to reduce the time and energy devoted to the clerical and managerial tasks associated with editing a monograph, while improving the record-keeping and efficiency of editorial processes. It seeks to improve the scholarly and public quality of monograph publishing through a number of innovations, including enhancing the reader experience, making publishing policies more transparent, and improving indexing.

This book covers OMP version 1.2, released in April 2016. We hope you find it helpful for your publishing projects.
