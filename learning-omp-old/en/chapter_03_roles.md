# Roles in OMP

The OMP workflow revolves around different roles for different users, allowing them access to different parts of the workflow, and different permissions and responsibilities.

You can also create new roles or rename existing ones. More information on configuring roles is available in Chapter 5.

## Site Administrator

The Site Administrator is responsible for the overall OMP installation, ensuring the server settings are accurate, adding language files, and creating any new presses on the installation. The Site Administrator account is created as part of the installation process. Unlike all other OMP roles, there can only be one Site Administrator.

See Chapter 4: Site Administration for more details.
